After a chastening eight-wicket defeat in the second T20I against India in Rajkot, the Bangladesh contingent moved to Nagpur yesterday for the series decider on Sunday.
They eventually took off from Rajkot at around 1:45pm local time and reached Nagpur an hour and a half later.
“If we don’t repeat the mistakes of the last match, of course we can win the series,” Shafiul told the reporters.
“We made a few mistakes with the bat and ball and we have to work on those departments.
“Obviously we are disappointed since we could have clinched the series if we played well,” he added.
