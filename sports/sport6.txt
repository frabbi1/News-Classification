Cristiano Ronaldo's lawyers won a courtroom bid Thursday to block a Nevada woman accusing the soccer superstar of raping her in Las Vegas in 2009 from digging into the validity of their 2010 confidentiality agreement and $375,000 hush-money payment.
Albregts, who was named in August to the U.S.District Court, now handles filings and pretrial arguments in a case that Ronaldo's lawyers want dismissed or moved to private talks.
Now that it is, Ronaldo's lawyers say the contract calls for out-of-court arbitration to resolve the dispute.
Ronaldo's lawyers also maintain that news reports in Europe in 2017 about the settlement and payment were based on electronic data that was illegally hacked, stolen and sold by cybercriminals.
They say they believe the documents have been altered and complain that Mayorga's lawsuit is damaging Ronaldo's reputation.
