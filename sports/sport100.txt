﻿﻿The name of Deepak Aggarwal is not new in the list of bookies.
According to the ICC statement, bookie Deepak Aggarwal approached to Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan three times in 2018 with ill attempts.
But, it is not yet known whether the ICC or India will take any action against Deepak Aggarwal.
India's blacklisted bookie Aggarwal was arrested by police along with his two accomplices in April 2017.
On the other hand, bookie Deepak Aggarwal may be making a new trap for a cricketer, either big star or new comer.
