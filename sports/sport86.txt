A fire yesterday gutted one of the rooms on the first floor of the old building of the National Sport Council, but fortunately none of the sportspersons, who are camping in adjacent rooms for the upcoming South Asian Games, were injured as it happened on Friday when all the players were on leave.
Niazul Nahid, officer of the general section of the NSC, confirmed the news to The Daily Star.
Authorities are suspecting a short circuit to be the reason for the fire but the extent of damage is yet to be ascertained,” Niaz said.
The first floor of the building is hosting the women’s kabaddi team, men’s and women’s weightlifting teams and men’ and women’s taekwondo teams for the SA Games camp.
Had the fire broken out on another day, something more serious could have happened.
