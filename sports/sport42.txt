Bangladesh captain Mahmudullah Riyad told the media that the Tigers are eager to make history by winning the second T20I in Rajkot.
“It’s a big opportunity for us to seal the series against India.
Along with some world-class spinners, we have a good bunch of pacers as well,” the Bangladesh captain said.
Young all-rounder Afif Hossain also talked to the media before the second game.
Before heading to this series, Bangladesh played eight T20Is against India but failed to register any win.
