The threat of inclement weather looming over the second T20I between India and Bangladesh in Rajkot has reduced with the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) saying Cyclone Maha has weakened and moved to the eastern parts of India.
The chances of the match starting on time were further increased as Rajkot woke up to a sunny morning, and that weather has persisted through the day.
As per the IMD's previous forecast, Cyclone Maha was scheduled to land in Gujarat on November 6, threatening to cause "heavy or very heavy rains".
That threat nearly materialised after thunder and heavy downpour hit Rajkot early evening on Wednesday.
Though conditions are to remain cloudy as per the forecast, Shah is confident about the drainage facilities at the Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium.
