But Bangladesh opener Imrul Kayes believes playing with the pink ball will not be a problem, as both the teams are playing with the same balls.
"I did not play any (day-night) match with the pink balls before.
I think the pink balls swing more than traditional white or red balls.
I don't think it will create any problem for us to adapt with the pink balls.
Imrul Kayes and the other members of Bangladesh Test squad will fly for India on November 8.
