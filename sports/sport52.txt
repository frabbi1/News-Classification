After suffering a crushing defeat in the national capital, the young Indian team will look to bounce back when they face Bangladesh in the second T20I on Thursday at the Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium.
Last Sunday, Bangladesh beat India by seven wickets in the series opener, chasing down a modest target of 149 with ease.
It was their first victory over India in the shortest format.
For India, it will be about coming out with an improved performance in all the three departments.
You know there are three matches and it's a bilateral series, not a knockout format," said the leg-spinner on Tuesday.
