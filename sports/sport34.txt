Bangladesh top-order batsman Soumya Sarkar and one more player had vomited during the first game of the three-match T20 series against India, Hindustan Times said quoting an ESPN Cricinfo report.
Bangladesh beat India for the first time in the shortest version of the game in that match, but it now appears that they had to in fact battle hard with the poor air quality of Delhi as well.
“Post-Diwali is a difficult time in the north because winter sets in and there is lot of smoke & dust.
In future, when we schedule, especially in the northern part of India in the winter we will have to be a little more practical.
I have spoken to the groundsmen, he says once the sun comes out, it will be fine.”
