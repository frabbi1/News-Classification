There are 22 academies in Rajkot which provide optimum support to both boys’ and girls’ age-level cricket teams.
15 to 20 ball-boys were selected from such academies in Rajkot for yesterday’s match.
It was an opportunity to inspire the next generation of stars.
“These academies are also involved with some leading schools and we play with these school teams according to respective age groups,” he added.
Jahir, a fast bowler from one of the academies, said that he was admitted to the academy because he wanted to get into the school team.
