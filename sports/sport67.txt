Two former Indian Premier League players have been arrested for spot-fixing in a scandal-ridden regional tournament, police said Thursday.
Wicketkeeper-batsman CM Gautam and Abrar Kazi were arrested in Bangalore by a special unit investigating corruption and fixing in the Karnataka Premier League.
“The Central Crime Branch has made two important arrests in the KPL spot-fixing scandal,” Sandeep Patil, Joint Commissioner of Police, told AFP, naming Gautam and Kazi.
The KPL has been under growing suspicion since Ashfaq Ali Thara, owner of a KPL team and a side in the Dubai T20 League, was arrested for placing bets and a possible role in fixing matches.
Two more players were arrested on charges of betting and match-fixing.
