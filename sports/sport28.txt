Rohit Sharma hammered 85 in 43 balls to lead India to an easy eight-wicket victory over Bangladesh in the second T20 in Rajkot on Thursday.
The India win levelled the three-game series, after the visitors had won the first one by seven wickets.
Rohit was smashing the Tigers bowlers all over the park from the beginning and the visitors did not have any answer to his fireworks.
Rohit looked all set for another T20 ton, but he fell to Aminul Islam as substitute Mohammad Mithun took a catch near the boundary rope.
Put into bat first, a 60-run opening partnership between Mohammad Naim and Liton Das helped Bangladesh make 153 for 6.
