After a flying start in the three-match T20I series against India, Bangladesh are now in Rajkot gearing up for the second match which is scheduled for 7 November, reports news agency UNB.
The Mahmudullah Riyad-led Bangladesh team reached Rajkot on Monday and they conducted a practices session on Tuesday.
Before heading to this series, Bangladesh played eight T20Is against India but failed to win any of them.
Mushfiqur Rahim, the hero of the Delhi win, said they are thinking nothing but a series win in India now.
After the T20I series, both teams will lock horns in a two-match Test series.
