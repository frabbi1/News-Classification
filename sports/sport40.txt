A 60-run opening partnership between Mohammad Naim and Liton Das helped Bangladesh make 153 for 6 in the second T20 against India in Rajkot on Thursday.
Naim was the top-scorer with 36 off 31 while the attacking Liton hit 29 off 21 balls.
One-down Soumya Sarkar kept up the tempo with 30 off 20 balls, firing two fours and the innings' only six, while captain Mahmudullah also made 30 in 21 balls, courtesy of four fours.
Winning the toss, India asked Bangladesh to bowl, and now they need to chase a modest target to save the series.
Or else Bangladesh will seal a historic series win.
