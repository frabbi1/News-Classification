FIFA has told soccer's biggest agents, who are resisting limits to their cut of player deals, that there is a need to "curb the excesses" of the $7 billion annual transfer market.
FIFA officials responded in writing to the agents on Tuesday, saying there was an "extensive consultation process with all the main stakeholders," including agents as a well as "robust research."
New rules are also due to cap the agent's fees at 3% of a player's salary, or 6% when they are also acting for the buying club.
Calling the process undemocratic, Raiola, Barnett and Wittmann told FIFA they should be allowed to earn as much from a deal as the players or clubs approve.
"Far from being anti-competitive or in any way illegal, the measures proposed by FIFA are moderate, well thought out and reasonable," FIFA responded.
