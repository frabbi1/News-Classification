Deepak Aggarwal, the alleged bookmaker named by the ICC as the man who approached Bangladesh star Shakib Al Hasan for inside information, had been a regular on the international cricket circuit and claimed to be a promoter of a planned T20 league.
A day after Shakib was banned for two years, those close to the ICC anti-corruption unit said Aggarwal hails from Sonepat in Haryana but is now based out of Dubai.
He also runs a cricket academy in the National Capital Region, reports Indian Express.“Aggarwal came on Dubai’s ICC anti-corruption unit’s radar because of his suspicious movement during a game in Abu Dhabi.
After that he was put under surveillance and this brought to light his frequent interactions with Hasan,” a source told The Indian Express.
