A dramatic England collapse which saw five wickets fall for only 10 runs allowed New Zealand to snatch a 14-run victory in their Twenty20 international in Nelson Tuesday.
It also put New Zealand 2-1 ahead in the series with two games to play.
Dawid Malan (55) and James Vince (49) had laid a solid foundation for England at the top of the innings.
"That's one that got away," England captain Morgan said, pointing to the lack of experience in his squad.
But we knew if we could keep taking wickets it would be touch for them," New Zealand captain Tim Southee said.
