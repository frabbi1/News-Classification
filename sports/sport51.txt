Mominul Haque says he was stunned to be named Bangladesh Test captain in place of the banned Shakib Al Hasan but is relishing the chance to take on Virat Kohli's side in India.
I never thought even in my dreams that I will be the captain of Bangladesh or I will captain the Test side," he said late Wednesday.
Mominul has played 36 Tests and scored 2,613 runs and has the highest average among his country's batsmen at 41.47.
It is a very good chance to play good cricket," the left-hander said while insisting the captaincy would not affect his game.
If I keep thinking that as a captain I have to take extra responsibility to carry the team forward then I will be in some pressure," he said.
