Even though the threat of Cyclone Maha looms large over the second T20I in Rajkot, Bangladesh captain Mahmudullah Riyad believes that they are standing on a good chance to clinch the T20 series against India.
If Mahmudullah’s side could materialize it, they would be the first overseas team to beat India in the Indian soil in three-match T20 series.
The senior all-rounder who was given the responsibility of leading the side after regular skipper Shakib Al Hasan was banned for two years for breaching the code of conduct of ICC, knew well that the series win would be tough task to achieve.
“Obviously, I think, it is a great-great opportunity especially when you have already won the first game in the series,” Mahmudullah said during the pre-match conference at Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Rajkot on Wednesday.
“If you concentrate on the recent (developments), whatever is going on in Bangladesh cricket, a series win will be a big boost for Bangladesh cricket and also a big boost for Bangladesh cricket team,” said Mahmudullah.
