India all-rounder Washington Sundar said that his side were confident of clinching the series after the resounding eight-wicket win in the second T20I in Rajkot yesterday levelled the three-match series 1-1.
Bangladesh were buoyed by their win in Delhi -- their first-ever T20I win against India -- but Sundar believed that his side had the edge in the series decider as the Nagpur wicket will be similar to the one from Rajkot.
We won convincingly today and we can expect a similar track and boundaries in Nagpur so definitely we will look to win the next game,” he said when asked if India were in the driving seat leading up to the third T20I in Nagpur on Sunday.
Sundar mentioned that things went in their favour right from the toss, up to skipper Rohit Sharma hitting 85 off 43 balls.
Even in the Bangladesh Premier League, they have similar tracks as Delhi’s so it suited them better and they played well that night.”
