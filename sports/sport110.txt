The Bangladesh national cricket team reached India at 5 pm (local time) on Wednesday, said Bangladesh Cricket Board Media Manager Rabid Imam.
The tigers left the country to play a full series against India for the first time since their elevation as a Test nation in 2000.
The series is comprised with three-match T20 Internationals and two-match Test series, with which the Tigers will start their journey in the World Test Champions game.
The ace all-rounder was set to lead the side in India tour as he was the captain of the team in both T20 and Test format.
Moreover Bangladesh relied heavily on his service in India tour since he has vast knowledge about the country due to play IPL at regular basis.
