Master batsman Steve Smith stroked a faultless unbeaten 80 as Australia edged Pakistan by seven wickets in Canberra to go 1-0 up in their three-match Twenty20 series.
Top-ranked Pakistan set a competitive 150 for six off their 20 overs, with skipper Babar Azam hitting his second consecutive half-century and Iftikhar Ahmed clubbing a quickfire 62.
It put them 1-0 up after the opening match in Sydney on Sunday was abandoned due to rain.
"Credit goes to Smith," said Azam.
It left Smith and Ashton Turner with 45 runs to win off 42 balls, which they managed comfortably.
