Paris Saint-Germain sporting director Leonardo has hit out at Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane for suggesting that Kylian Mbappe’s dream was to play for the Spanish club.
Zidane was asked about a possible move for the 20-year-old World Cup-winning star in a press conference in Madrid on Tuesday.
He has always said it was his dream to play for Real Madrid,” Zidane replied.
A clearly irked Leonardo, who returned to Paris for a second spell in the role of sporting director earlier this year, said the comments were an attempt to unsettle the striker.
They travel to Madrid to face Zidane’s Real in their next Group A game later this month.
