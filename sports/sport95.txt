Former New Zealand fast bowler Shane Bond has set his sights on the role of England’s bowling coach.
With Chris Silverwood taking the role of the head coach, England roped in Darren Gough to work with the bowlers in the lead-up to the two-Test series in New Zealand.
I caught up with them in Christchurch when they down for their pre-season tournament [T20 warm-up fixtures].
I really enjoyed being with the team and liked the guys,” Bond said.
“I think you look at everything that’s put in front of you, wherever the opportunities come up.”
