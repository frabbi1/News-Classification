For Bangladesh, there was not much to take heart from except leg-spinner Aminul Islam’s performance during that tough period while everyone else was going for runs.
Having bagged two important wickets in the first T20I, Aminul turned out to be the only bowler who survived the Rohit storm.
He was praised by captain Mahmudullah Riyad after the game for showing courage.
I told him that if you can do well against strong opposition such as this, you will have more self-confidence,” Mahmudullah said of Aminul.
Not long ago, 20-year-old Aminul was playing for the emerging team and the Bangladesh A team.
