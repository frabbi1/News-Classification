Newly-appointed Test skipper of Bangladesh, Mominul Haque, has said that he the appointment came as a surprise to him, and that he wasn't ready for such a role.
"I was never ready [for captaincy] and it was totally unexpected.
Never thought that I would be captain of Bangladesh team, the Test team.
"I never thought captaincy is any kind of extra pressure or responsibility because if I think that way then certainly it will be extra pressure.
The way I've played before to score runs and play for the team, I am trying to play like that," he said.
