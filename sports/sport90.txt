Shafiul Islam spoke in front of the media present and reiterated that the Tigers still feel strong despite the setback of losing the second T20I by eight wickets in Rajkot.
“If we don’t repeat the mistakes of the last match, ofcourse we can win the series,” pace bowler Shafiul Islam told the media present at the team hotel.
“We are still strong.
“Obviously we are disappointed since we could have clinched the series if we played well,” he reiterated.
The Bangladesh team think-tank will now move to Nagpur and hope to find the answers of what went wrong in the second T20I at Rajkot and how to rectify those errors.
