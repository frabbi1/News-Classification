Standing on the brink of a history, Bangladesh will lock horns against hosts India in the second T20 of the three-match series at Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Rajkot today.
A victory will not only just confirm a mere series victory; the magnitude of that victory would be huge.
They seems to be confident indeed after gaining momentum by thrashing India in the first match by seven wickets.
“This is our best chance to win the series,” Bangladesh captain Mahmudullah Riyad said during the pre-match conference on Wednesday.
There are also some stats on the cards for Tigers players, which they could use as motivation to beat India.
