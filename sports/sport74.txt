Meghalaya off-spinner Nirdesh Baisoya claimed a rare feat by taking all 10 wickets in an innings in a U-16 Vijay Merchant Trophy fixture against Nagaland in Tezpur on Wednesday.
The 15-year-old bowler, originally from Meerut, moved to Meghalaya as a guest player two years ago.
He was coached by Sanjay Rastogi, a coach who has also trained India seamers Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Praveen Kumar.
“I have been training under Rastogi sir since childhood and I train regularly at the Victoria Park in Meerut,” Baisoya told Sportstar on Wednesday.
In reply, Meghalaya finished Day 1 on 109/4.
