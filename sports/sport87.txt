Bangladesh had complete control of things early on in the do-or-die match for India during the second T20I at Rajkotâ€™s Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium yesterday.
Having been asked to bat, Liton Das and Naim Sheikh seized the upper hand right away.
Pant did not have to rue the mistake for long as Liton fell to a brain-fade, unable to read a googly from Yuzvendra Chahal and then risking a run without knowing where the ball went.
Mahmudullah Riyad was watchful while India tidied things up after bowling loose deliveries at the start of the innings.
Failure to keep focus and throwing away wickets undid the Tigers and they were left needing a special effort from the bowlers.
