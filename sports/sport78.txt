Ruthless opening pair Aaron Finch and David Warner ran riot as Australia routed Pakistan by 10 wickets in Perth to wrap up their Twenty20 series 2-0 Friday in emphatic fashion.
The home team won in Canberra by seven wickets, thanks to a brilliant 80 not out by Steve Smith, and were on track to also triumph in Sydney only for rain to save the visitors.
Each time we turn up at training, we are improving ourselves and that is very important,” said captain Finch.

We have learnt a lot from this series and we’ll take the positives and come back hard in the next series,” said skipper Babar Azam.
