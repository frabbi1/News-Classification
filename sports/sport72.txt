After the thumping eight-wicket loss, Mahmudullah rued the fact that set batsmen gifted wickets yesterday after showing maturity during the last T20I in Delhi on Sunday.
I hope he will realise his mistakes and score better in the next match,” Mahmudullah said.
“It is important that a set batsman stays at the wicket for 15 to 16 overs on this kind of wicket.
“Obviously, their [India’s] confidence will be high after this performance but I don’t think we will be lacking in self-confidence.
We have shown in the first match that we can play well and it’s important not to lose that self-confidence.
