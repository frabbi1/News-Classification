Standing on the brink of a history, Bangladesh will lock horns against hosts India in the second T20 of three-match series at Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Rajkot tomorrow.
A victory will not only just confirm a mere series victory; the magnitude of that victory would be huge.
If they can beat India for the second match in a row to take an unassailable lead, Bangladesh would be the first overseas team in the history to win a three-match bilateral T20I series against India on Indian soil.
“This is our best chance to win the series,” Bangladesh captain Mahmudullah Riyad said during the pre-match conference on Wednesday.
Bangladesh captain Mahmudullah needs two sixes to hit 50 sixes in T20Is, he will be the 1st Bangladesh cricketer to hit 50 sixes in T20Is.
