All-rounder Forhad Reza is the only Bangladeshi cricketer who has been picked up by the Bengal Tigers for the upcoming T10 cricket league in Abu Dhabi.
The owners of the Bengal Tigers, who are mainly based in Chattogram, had earlier roped in Junaid Siddique, Mahedi Hasan, Abu Hider, Yasir Ali, Enamul Haque, Arafat Sunny and Forhad.
However, Bangladesh Cricket Board CEO Nizamuddin Chowdhury informed that apart from Forhad, the board did not grant No Objection Certificates for the other six professional cricketers.
Forhad will play alongside the likes of Thisara Perera, Colin Ingram, Andre Fletcher and others.
Former Bangladesh cricketers Aftab Ahmed and Nafees Iqbal will act as head coach and team manager respectively for the Bengal Tigers.
