Brazilian forward Rodrygo announced himself on club football's biggest stage with a 'perfect' hat-trick in Real Madrid's 6-0 defeat of Galatasaray.
The 18-year-old became the second youngest player to score a Champions League treble, behind only Real legend Raul, reports BBC.
Wayne Rooney - also then 18 - was older than Rodyrgo when he scored a Champions League hat-trick on his Manchester United debut against another Turkish side, Fenerbahce, in 2004.
The 31-year-old French striker's first Champions League goal came at the age of 17, when he scored for Lyon against Rosenborg on 6 December, 2005.
In his 15 Champions League seasons he has scored 62 times, averaging more than four a season.
