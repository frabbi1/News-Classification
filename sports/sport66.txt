The young off-spinner exuded confidence after Tigers’ T20I squad got off a flying start on tour by winning the first T20I in New Delhi.
The first Test of the two-match series will start in Indore from November 14 and the final Test will take place in Kolkata from November 22.
Mental preparation is very important because it would not be an easy task to play Tests on Indian soil.
I am hopeful because of the way we are preparing for the series.
But we have our [spin] bowling consultant Daniel Vettori and I hope I can learn many things from him,” said Mehedi.
