Rodrygo scored a sensational hat-trick and the fastest two goals in Champions League history on Wednesday as Real Madrid humiliated Galatasaray 6-0.
Benzema then added a fifth late in the second half, leaving Rodrygo to complete his incredible treble in injury-time.
Yet the knock-out stages are far away and Rodrygo is the man of the moment.
Benzema scored his second late on, tapping in from close range to make it five, before Rodrygo raced in from the left, exchanged passes with the Frenchman, and poked in.
After the final whistle, he kissed the matchball as he left, while the fans chanted his name.
