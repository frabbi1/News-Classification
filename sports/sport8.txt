Ernesto Valverde admitted Barcelona are in a rut after they followed up their La Liga defeat by Levante with a goalless draw at home to Slavia Prague on Tuesday in the Champions League.
“We haven't been convincing either on Saturday or today and we know there is a lot of pressure now on the team.
“In football today and with teams like ours, it is all about winning and winning emphatically,” Valverde said.
The season begins and there isn't talk of winning a title, there is talk of winning three or four.
Barcelona were sloppy in possession and lacklustre out of it.
