India have won the toss in the second T20I of the three-match series and sent Bangladesh to bat first at Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Rajkot on Thursday.
With the win in the first game in Delhi, Bangladesh are leading the series 1-0.
In the first game on November 3, Bangladesh beat India by a big margin of seven wickets riding on the bat of Mushfiqur Rahim who remained unbeaten hitting 60.
The economic bowling effort helped Bangladesh to create a chance to beat India in T20Is for the first time.
The batsmen have materialised the chance and recorded Bangladesh's maiden T20 win over India.
