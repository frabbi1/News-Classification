Two Bangladeshi cricketers reportedly vomited on the pitch due to air pollution in Delhi.
The international cricket match between India and Bangladesh was held in Delhi during a time when a public health emergency was declared in the national capital and schools remained shut.
The horrifying air quality in pollution-choked Delhi caused Bangladeshâ€™s Soumya Sarkar and one of his teammates to vomit on the pitch.
The poisonous haze and ongoing ecological crisis had not deterred the cricket boards from insisting on continuing with the match and the players had to face the eye-burning smog in the city.
