The prayers from the cricket fans were answered as Rajkot saw sunshine from early yesterday morning.
The Tigers had seen bright and sunny days ever since arriving in Rajkot but a storm gathered in the early evening on Wednesday, raking in gusts of wind.
Rajkot had only hosted two T20Is before this game and expectant crowds had gathered outside the stadium.
While riding through the city, a taxi driver informed this reporter about cricket-crazy Rajkot.
“We are a small town but you know what, we are the craziest about cricket in all India,” he said.
