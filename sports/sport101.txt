Bangladesh are going to start their India tour by taking on the hosts in the first of three-match T20 series on Sunday at Arun Jaitley Stadium facing severe air pollution in Delhi.
The game is India’s first International fixture after the Diwali when the air pollution remains severe.
The three-match T20 series is indeed the both side’s reparations for 2020 October’s Men’s T20 World Cup.
That Bangladesh is yet to learn the art of T20 cricket is evidenced in the stats.
India is currently fifth ranked team in T20 cricket while Bangladesh currently sits in ninth.
