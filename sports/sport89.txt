The fifth round of the 21st edition of the National Cricket League (NCL) will commence today with Khulna Division sitting on top of the points table in Tier 1 after accumulating 26.46 points.
Khulna will play Rajshahi Division in Mirpur while Dhaka Division will face Rangpur Division in Chattogram.
Meanwhile, Barishal Division, playing at home, will try to get the better of Chittagong Division and Dhaka Metropolis will face Sylhet Division in Coxâ€™s Bazar.
The leaders can gain a maximum of nine points for a win -- eight for a win and a bonus point for registering two consecutive victories.
However, so far it seems all four Tier 2 teams have a chance to be promoted to the top tier with little separating them in terms of points.
