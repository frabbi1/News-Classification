William Porterfield has stepped down as Ireland’s Test and one-day captain after more than 11 years at the helm with Andrew Balbirnie succeeding him, Cricket Ireland said on Friday.
Since taking over from former skipper Trent Johnston in 2008, Porterfield has led the senior team 253 times, including when Ireland debuted as a Test nation in May last year.
“It has been an incredible journey, and a fantastic honour to have captained my country over the past 11 and a half years,” Porterfield said in a statement.
