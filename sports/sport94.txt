Inter Milan and Napoli return to the Serie A fray after a disappointing week of European football for the Italian giants as leaders Juventus look to pull clear after punching their ticket to the Champions League last 16.
Juventus have 29 points from 11 games, one point ahead of Inter Milan, with resurgent Roma a further six points adrift in third.
A win over struggling AC Milan would allow Juventus to keep ahead of Inter, who host midtable Verona after their 3-2 Champions League defeat by Borussia Dortmund.
Napoli have slipped 11 points off the pace after collecting just two points from their last three matches.
Ancelottiâ€™s side also missed a chance to secure their Champions League last 16 berth with a 1-1 stalemate against Salzburg.
