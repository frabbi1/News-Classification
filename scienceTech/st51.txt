Japan’s second largest telecom company KDDI has shown its interest to invest in Bangladesh’s 5G network, IOT, other digital technologies and special economic zones and connectivity sectors.
Earlier in 2018, the minister joined an IT week in Japan and urged the KDDI authority to invest in Bangladesh’s IT sector.
Subsequently, the KDDI delegation is visiting Bangladesh for feasibility study in this regard.
The KDDI delegation informed the minister that they will open an office in Dhaka soon and identify the sectors for investment.
The other member of the KDDI delegation was deputy managing director of its Singapore ICT sales department Takeshi Awa.
