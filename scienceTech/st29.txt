Just two degrees of warming causes lizards to change their eating habits resulting in less healthy adult reptiles, according to research published Wednesday.
Lizards generally live on a diet of insects, including plant-eaters, like crickets, as well as predators, such as spiders and beetles.
"One of our hypotheses is that in warmer climates, lizards needed more nutritious prey to fulfil their demands and shifted their diet towards eating more predatory invertebrates," Bestion said.
Another notable finding is that as the lizards' diets changed, the microbiota in their guts became less diverse, possibly resulting in lower survival of the lizards.
Crucially, the study, published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, also suggests that a shift in reptile diets to predators might disrupt eating habits further up the food chain.
