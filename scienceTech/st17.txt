Google parent company Alphabet reported mixed third-quarter results Monday, beating analyst expectations for revenue but falling short on profits.
Alphabet makes the majority of its money from selling targeted advertising across the web, apps and Google products including its search engine and video streaming site YouTube.
Investors are now also closely watching the growth of Google's cloud business.
While that number covers companywide hires, Google has made it clear that hiring engineers and especially sales workers for its cloud business is a priority.
The company's cloud business is undeniably growing, although it still trails well behind competitors Amazon and Microsoft.
