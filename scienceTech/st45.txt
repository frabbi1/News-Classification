Apple has put out new gender neutral emojis of most of its people icons -- including punks, clowns and zombies -- as part of an update to its mobile operating system.
The new gender neutral emojis differ slightly from the male and female ones.
In others the haircuts are different and a "gender neutral facial structure" is used, says the Emojipedia website.
"How do u determine that these emojis are how gender-neutrality should be represented or that these emojis even represent most gnc people," wrote one Twitter user.
Apple also serves up some niche offerings in the new update including a plate of falafel, a skunk and a banjo.
