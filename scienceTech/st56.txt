The new gender-neutral emojis differ slightly from the male and female ones.
In some, the style and colour of their clothes is changed.
In others the haircuts are different and a "gender-neutral facial structure" is used, says the Emojipedia website.
The attempt at on-screen inclusivity has not pleased everyone however, with some suggesting the icons indicate how gender-nonconforming people should look.
