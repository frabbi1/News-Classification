Twitter is to ban all political advertising worldwide, saying that the reach of such messages "should be earned, not bought".
Social media rival Facebook recently ruled out a ban on political ads.
News of the ban divided America's political camps for the 2020 election.
Brad Parscale, manager of President Donald Trump's re-election campaign, said the ban was "yet another attempt by the left to silence Trump and conservatives".
Twitter's ban will be enforced from 22 November, with full details released by 15 November.
