Studying mice, Carrasquillo and her colleagues found that the activity in neurons that express protein kinase C-delta amplified pain, while neurons that express somatostatin inhibited the chain of activity in the nerves required to communicate pain.
The central amygdala isn’t completely responsible for pain itself: if it were removed entirely, then “the ‘ouch’ of things, or the protective pain, would remain intact,” said Carrasquillo.
“The healthy response is you get pain, it tells you something is wrong, it heals, and the pain goes away,” said Carrasquillo.
“In chronic pain, that doesn’t happen, the system gets stuck.
If we can identify what makes the system gets stuck, then we can reverse it.”
