Executives involved with Facebook's proposed Libra digital currency say they will work with regulators to address their concerns.

Marcus said it has been "very clear to us from the very beginning that a payment networks such as the Libra network shouldn't be controlled by one company."
Central banks and government finance officials have long worried about the challenges posed by digital currencies, and the risk they can be used for money laundering and financing terrorism.
Libra is different from other digital currencies like Bitcoin because it would be a "stablecoin" tied to national currencies.
