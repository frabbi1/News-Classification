Chinese tech giant Xiaomi has unveiled the world's first mainstream handset to feature a 108-megapixel camera.
But Xiaomi has said it will use the same component in the Mi Note 10, which will be launched on Wednesday and sold more widely.
The firm is currently the world's fourth-bestselling smartphone vendor, according to research firm Canalys, with a market share of 9.1%.
Xiaomi previously announced it would use the 108MP sensor in the Mi Mix Alpha, which was unveiled in September.
One expert said the inclusion of the camera in the mass market Mi CC9 Pro and Mi Note 10 should help the phones stand out.
