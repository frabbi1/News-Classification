The Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover — or VIPER — will take samples of moon soil, looking for evidence of water-ice, NASA announced Friday.
“Since the confirmation of lunar water-ice ten years ago, the question now is if the moon could really contain the amount of resources we need to live off-world.
This rover will help us answer the many questions we have about where the water is, and how much there is for us to use.”Also read: NASA to send robotic rover to map water ice on moonBK
