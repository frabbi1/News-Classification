Modern humans emerged 200,000 years ago in a region of northern Botswana, scientists claimed Monday, in what appeared to be the most precise location of mankind's "ancestral homeland" yet discovered.
While it has long been known anatomically modern humans -- homo sapiens sapiens -- originated in Africa, scientists have until now been unable to pinpoint the precise location of our species' birthplace.
"But what we hadn't known until the study was where exactly this homeland was."
"More rainfall around 130,000 years ago, northeast of the homeland, created a green corridor for migration for the first group."
"We're talking about anatomically modern humans, people living today," said Hayes.
