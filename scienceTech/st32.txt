Within 700,000 years of the mass extinction, their body mass had become 100 times bigger than the mammals living immediately after the mass extinction.
The thousands of well-preserved animal and plant fossils, unearthed just east of Colorado Springs, illuminate a time interval that had been shrouded in mystery.
Sixteen mammal species were discovered, with skulls and other bones fossilised after being buried in rivers and floodplains.
Most of the 16 mammal species belonged to a diverse group called "archaic ungulates" related to modern-day hoofed mammals like deer, cows and pigs.
The plant fossils included pollen, leaf impressions and petrified wood.
