US astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir became the first all-female pairing to carry out a spacewalk Friday, a historic milestone as NASA prepares to send the first woman to the Moon.
"Christina, you may egress the airlock," spacecraft communicator Stephanie Wilson said as the pair set out to replace a power controller on the International Space Station at 1138 GMT.
In a call to reporters a few minutes earlier, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine emphasized the symbolic significance of the day.
When they had been outside space station for about five hours, President Donald Trump reached the astronauts in a video call and told them they had made history.
Ken Bowersox, NASA acting associate administrator, said he hoped that an all-female spacewalk would soon be a "routine" matter that would not require celebration.
