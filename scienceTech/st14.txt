Bangladesh Telecommunication Company Limited (BTCL) will give land phone connections to the intending clients free of cost marking the ‘Mujib Year’, the birth centenary of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
“BTCL will give land phone connections to the applicants free of cost from today marking the ‘Mujib Year’.
It will continue throughout the year of 2020,” Posts and Telecommunications Division Minister Mustafa Jabbar told journalists at his Secretariat office on Tuesday .
Noting that BTCL’s monthly line rent of Taka 180 has been withdrawn earlier, the minister said the service recipients can talk over land phone to land phone for Taka 150 per month while land phone to other mobile telecom operators will cost Taka 0.52 per minute.
The number of land phone service recipients has increased after withdrawing the BTCL’s line rent, Mustafa Jabbar said and hoped that it will continue to increase in future.
