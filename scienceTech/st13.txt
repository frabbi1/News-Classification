Such fully autonomous weapons are also called lethal autonomous weapons systems at the talks in Geneva," said Wareham.
"We believe that they (killer robots) cross the threshold of acceptability and therefore must be prohibited," she said at a press conference held at the UN headquarters in New York.
"I think that they were hoping and really expecting the larger community would not find out about the research and development of killer robots," she said.
