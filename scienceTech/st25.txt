The site has led to many discoveries from the late Lower Paleolithic period, some 400,000 years ago.
Bone marrow, a significant source of nutrition, long featured in the prehistoric diet.
"In our paper, we present evidence of storage and delayed consumption of bone marrow at the Qesem Cave," said professor Ran Barkai.
The bones were used as 'cans' that preserved the marrow for longer period until it was time to take off the dry skin, shatter the bone and eat the marrow.
According to the research, this is the earliest evidence of food preservation and delayed consumption.
