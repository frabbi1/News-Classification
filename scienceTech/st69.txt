After arriving for iPhone users quite a while back, WhatsApp has finally launched its biometric security authentication on Android devices.
After a short span of beta testing, the fingerprint unlock has finally made its way for all Android handsets.
In a blog post, WhatsApp states, â€œEarlier this year, we rolled out Touch ID and Face ID for iPhone to provide an extra layer of security for WhatsApp users.
To enable it, all you need to do is head into Settings> Account> Privacy> Fingerprint Unlock.
This is a convenient feature as you may not want to unlock your conversations every time you access the app.
