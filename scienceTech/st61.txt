Having a smartwatch that doesnâ€™t need charging is the ultimate fantasy for a tech lover.
A little-known brand called Matrix Industries has launched a product that does exactly that.
This time around, the solar-charging along with thermoelectric enable the watch to attain more smartwatch features that also challenge the Fitbits and Garmins of the planet.
The Matrix PowerWatch works seamlessly with Apple HealthKit and Google Fit and also be used with additional third-party apps.
The Matrix PowerWatch is on sale on Indiegogo for USD 200 and will climb all the way up to USD 499 when it goes on sale.
