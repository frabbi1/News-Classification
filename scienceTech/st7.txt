The US government is ready to provide support to Bangladeshi organisations, including the countryâ€™s central bank, to help them fight cyber attacks on all fronts.
Currently, at least 1,700 North Korean hackers are active online to steal funds from financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges to generate income, according to sources.
There are over 1,000 North Korean citizens, mostly as construction workers and IT engineers, working in Bangladesh at present.
When asked about the North Korean citizens working in Bangladesh as IT professionals, the state minister said law enforcement and intelligence agencies were working on the matter.
Senior officials of the South Korean foreign affairs ministry said they were also under the threat of cyber attacks from North Korean hackers.
