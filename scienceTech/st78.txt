Facebook is taking its most dramatic step to date to combat the spread of fake news on the far-reaching platform by introducing a “News” tab on its US user interface that will serve up stories from credible news organizations.
For now, Facebook is positioning the News tab as a test, which initially will be available to about 200,000 U.S. users.
The company emphasized that it consulted at length with major publishers and surveyed more than 100,000 Facebook users to design the Facebook News initiative.
“Today we’re starting to test Facebook News, a dedicated place for news on Facebook, to a subset of people in the US.
In next few months, Facebook News will incorporate local news from Today In, the company’s local news and community information tab, which recently expanded to over 6,000 US towns and cities.
