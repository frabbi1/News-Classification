Mars once had salt lakes similar to the ones on Earth and has gone through wet and dry periods, according to a new study.
Gale Crater was formed about 3.6 billion years ago when a meteor hit Mars.
"During these drying periods, salt ponds eventually formed.
The salt ponds on Mars are believed to be similar to some found on Earth, especially those in a region called Altiplano, which is near the Bolivia-Peru border.
Nachon added that the study shows that the ancient lake in Gale Crater underwent at least one episode of drying before "recovering."
