NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has given astronomers their best look yet at an interstellar visitor -- comet 2I/Borisov -- whose speed and trajectory indicate it has come from beyond our solar system.
Comet 2I/Borisov is only the second such interstellar object known to have passed through the solar system.
In 2017, the first identified interstellar visitor, an object officially named 'Oumuamua, swung within 24 million miles of the Sun before racing out of the solar system.
This Hubble image, taken on 12 October 2019, is the sharpest view of the comet to date, revealing a central concentration of dust around the nucleus.
Hubble photographed the comet at a distance of 260 million miles from Earth.
