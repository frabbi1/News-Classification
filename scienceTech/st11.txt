Facebook on Monday unveiled a new logo to represent the Silicon Valley company, distinct from its core social network.
"Today, we're updating our company branding to be clearer about the products that come from Facebook," Lucio said.
"We're introducing a new company logo and further distinguishing the Facebook company from the Facebook app, which will keep its own branding."
Since its start as a social networking application 15 years ago, Facebook has acquired Oculus virtual reality gear company as well as Instagram image-based social network.
It has also launched Portal smart screens as well as a Workplace social network tailored for workplace productivity.
