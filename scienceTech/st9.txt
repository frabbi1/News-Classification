A weak curriculum in information and technology (IT)-related subjects at the tertiary level of education in the country is depriving students of lucrative international jobs, especially in Japan.
University Grants Commission (UGC) sources said Japan is a big job market for Bangladeshi graduates having degrees in IT-related subjects.
The examinees have to obtain 60 per cent marks out of 100 to get a certificate for getting jobs in Japanese industries, UGC sources said.
The ITEE exams are conducted on the same date and time with the same set of questions among all ITPEC member countries.
A total of 2,592 students appeared for the ITEE exams, but only 188 passed.
