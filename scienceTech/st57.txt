Facebook-owned WhatsApp has filed a lawsuit against Israel's NSO Group, alleging the firm was behind cyber-attacks that infected devices with malicious software.
WhatsApp accuses the company of sending malware to roughly 1,400 mobile phones for the purposes of surveillance.
NSO Group, which makes software for surveillance, disputed the allegations.
In a court filing, WhatsApp said NSO Group "developed their malware in order to access messages and other communications after they were decrypted on target devices".
It said NSO Group created various WhatsApp accounts and caused the malicious code to be transmitted over the WhatsApp servers in April and May.
