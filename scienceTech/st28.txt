What makes some music so enjoyable, and can science help us engineer the perfect pop song?
A group of researchers who statistically analyzed tens of thousands of chord progressions in classic US Billboard hits say they have found the answer, and it lies in the right combination of uncertainty and surprise.
"It is fascinating that humans can derive pleasure from a piece of music just by how sounds are ordered over time," he said.
The scientists found that when the test subjects were relatively certain about what chord to expect next, they found it pleasant when they were instead surprised.
So could data help unlock the magic formula for song writing?
