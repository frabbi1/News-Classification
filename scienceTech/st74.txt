﻿China's mobile operators have made 5G services available to consumers, as the country seeks to become a global technology leader.
State-owned carriers China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom unveiled their 5G data plans on Thursday, reports BBC.
This would make it one of the world's largest 5G deployments, it said.
Huawei has supplied the largest amount of network equipment for China's 5G rollout and has been in talks with various other countries to help with their 5G networks.
Huawei denies this, and many in China see the US actions as part of its efforts to curb the rise of the world's second largest economy.
