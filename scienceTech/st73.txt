A huge cyber-attack has knocked out thousands of websites - as well as the national TV station - in the country of Georgia.
Irakli Chikhladze, head of news at TV station Imedi, posted on Facebook that there was no signal, and the station was unable to broadcast.
"The scale of this attack is something we haven't seen before," said Prof Alan Woodward, cyber-security expert at Surrey University.
"With the scale and the nature of the targets, it's difficult not to conclude that this was a state-sponsored attack."
Prof Woodward added that while the disruption caused had been "significant", critical national infrastructure did not appear to have been affected.
