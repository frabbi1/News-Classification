Vivo S5 is inching closer to its official debut on November 14, which means more teasers are on their way.
To drum up more hype for the upcoming phone, Vivo has shared official teaser images of the Vivo S5, which give us our first clear look at the phone from both sides.
The images shared by Vivo clearly show the Vivo S5 packing quad rear cameras, with the lenses and the LED flash arranged in a diamond-like pattern.
The first of the two new images shared by Vivo earlier today show the phone's front as well as rear panel.
Vivo S5 will reportedly draw power from an octa-core processor clocked at 2.3GHz, paired with up to 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage.
