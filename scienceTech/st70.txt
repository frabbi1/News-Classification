Microsoft Japan has announced the results of its 4-day work week trial, and it will shock no-one to know the experiment was hugely popular with the company's employees.
This August, Microsoft Japan trialed a 4-day work week for its entire workforce, calling the project the "Work-Life Choice Challenge Summer 2019".
This isn't the first time it's been demonstrated that shorter work hours have a positive effect on happiness and productivity.
However, the 4-day work week also comes with new challenges such as keeping up with customers and competition.
Microsoft Japan reportedly plans to repeat its 4-day work week experiment next summer, and possibly expand it to other times as well.
