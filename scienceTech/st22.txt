Google on Tuesday unveiled its newest Pixel handsets, aiming to boost its smartphone market share with features including gesture recognition that lets users simply wave their hands to get things done.
Pixel 4 models made their public debut as the internet titan updated its hardware lineup ahead of the year-end shopping season.
Google said Pixel 4 has a starting price of $799 in the United States and will be available starting 24 October.
While Pixel smartphones don't command much of the overall market, they provide an opportunity to showcase the Android operating system's capabilities and the Google Assistant, powered by artificial intelligence.
Stadia allows video game play on any internet-connected device, eliminating the need for games consoles.
