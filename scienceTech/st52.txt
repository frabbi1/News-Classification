Microsoft Corp said it has tracked "significant" cyber attacks coming from a group it calls "Strontium" or "Fancy Bear", targeting anti-doping authorities and global sporting organizations.
The group, also called APT28, has been linked to the Russian government, Microsoft said in a blog post.
At least 16 national and international sporting and anti-doping organizations across three continents were targeted in the attacks which began on 16 September, according to the company.
Microsoft has in the past taken legal steps o prevent Strontium from using fake Microsoft internet domains to execute its attacks.
Microsoft said at the time that hackers linked to Russia's government sought to launch cyber attacks on US political groups.
