Photo: APA Chinese maker of rabies vaccine that was fined 9.1 billion yuan ($1.3 billion) in a quality scandal that set off a crackdown on the industry said Friday it has been declared bankrupt.
Changchun Changsheng Life Sciences Ltd., which lost its production licenses last year, said in a statement that a court issued the ruling after concluding the company was insolvent and couldn't pay its debts.
Changsheng Life Sciences used expired materials, mixed different batches of products and failed to test them properly, according to regulators.
The company destroyed records to conceal its misconduct, they said.
2 leader, Premier Li Keqiang, said the company "violated a moral bottom line."
