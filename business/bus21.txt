Hong Kong might be heading for recession after months of violent protests but that hasn't stopped one businessman from forking out almost $1 million for a parking spot.
The HK$7.6 million ($970,000) price tag is more than 30 times the average annual wage in Hong Kong and about the same as a one-bed apartment in London's plush Chelsea area.
"To these tycoons, it's not a significant purchase if you compare it to the value of the office floors they own."
Hong Kong's white-hot property market has become a political issue as costs continue to soar, forcing some small businesses to close owing to sky-high rents while many residents cannot afford to buy or lease decent homes.
Commercial and residential property prices have been fuelled by an influx of money from wealthy mainland Chinese investors and developers.
