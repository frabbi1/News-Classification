India feared the deal's impact on its domestic industries, particularly in the key farming, dairy and textile sectors.
AFP PhotoIndian farmers and businesses yesterday hailed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision to opt out of a sprawling Asian trade pact, with the country's largest dairy producer Amul thanking the premier for "supporting livelihoods".
In a tweet late Monday, Amul applauded Modi's "exemplary leadership and support" to dairy farmers, who would have been exposed to more competition under the RCEP.
"Your vision of supporting their livelihood will help(in) doubling their incomes and make India stronger," it said.
B.M.Singh, convenor of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, said the rejection of the deal was "a huge victory for farmers".
