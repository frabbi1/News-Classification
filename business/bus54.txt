Most Asian markets were mixed Thursday after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates again and data showed the US economy remained "resilient", though gains were tempered by the bank's indication it is unlikely to make any more reductions.
His comments came after data showed growth dipped marginally in the third quarter to 1.9 percent but was much better than the 1.6 percent forecast.
Tokyo went into the break 0.2 percent higher and Singapore was up 0.6 percent, while Taipei put on 0.2 percent.
Seoul rallied 0.9 percent, boosted by a jump in market heavyweight Samsung after its earnings beat estimates.
But Shanghai eased 0.1 percent after figures pointed to another contraction of China's crucial manufacturing industry owing to the US trade war.
