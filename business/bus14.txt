The Digital Commerce Policy, which has revised to attract foreign investment, is yet to get the approval of the Cabinet Division.
The government brought changes in the policy by publishing a gazette notification following objections from foreign e-commerce ventures.
However, foreign e-commerce ventures raised objections when the government imposed a 49 per cent equity limit for foreign investors in the National Digital Commerce Policy-2018.
In the revised policy, a foreign investor can even hold 100 per cent equity, but 95 per cent of human resources will have to be local.
Jafar Uddin, senior secretary of the commerce ministry, said the draft of the Digital Commerce Policy was being revised to attract more foreign investment.
