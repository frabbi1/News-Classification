The central bank is set to relax the loan write-off policy once again in a space of nine months, bowing down to pressures from an influential quarter.
Experts came down heavily on the latest central bank move as it could further weaken the financial health of banks.
The central bank should follow the global best practice as the majority of the developed countries wait 3-4 years to write off their defaulted loans.
Cleaning up defaulted loans from balance sheet through using the write-off policy is not a good practice as it will give a wrong picture of the financial sector, said Mansur, also the executive director of the Policy Research Institute.
The central bank is now incapable of taking policy-related decisions freely thanks to a vested quarter, said Khondker Ibrahim Khaled, a former deputy governor of the BB.
