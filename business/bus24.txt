China and the United States have agreed to roll back tariffs on each others' goods in a "phase one" trade deal if it is completed, officials from both sides said on Thursday, sparking division among some advisers to president Donald Trump.
"I cannot get ahead of the talks with China, but we are very, very optimistic that we will reach a deal soon," she said.
Trump has used tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese goods as his primary weapon in the protracted trade war.
"There is no specific agreement for a phased rollback of the tariffs," said Michael Pillsbury, an outside adviser to Trump.
The optimism over a phase one trade deal boosted stocks globally; bond yields shuffled higher.
