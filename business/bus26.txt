America's budget deficit soared to nearly $1 trillion in the 2019 fiscal year as government borrowing swelled, the US Treasury announced Friday.
The fourth straight year of broadening budget gaps underscored a new tolerance for yawning fiscal imbalances in the current political era.
The fiscal 2019 deficit jumped by 26 per cent to $984 billion, the highest since 2012, as spending outstripped tax receipts in the wake of the 2017 Republican-led tax cuts, according to the Treasury.
The increase in the deficit paled in comparison to those recorded during and after the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009.
The 2019 fiscal year's deficit put Washington on a path to exceed forecasts from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, which in February said budget gaps should surpass $1 trillion beginning in 2022.
