Tesla Inc plans to double the number of repair and maintenance shops, add about 100 charging stations and revamp showrooms in China as the electric vehicle maker gears up to open its Shanghai plant.
Tesla had already treated China, the world’s biggest electric vehicle market, differently than elsewhere.
The company and Musk openly disdain marketing, but in China Tesla has offered racing events and showroom parties.
Tesla plans to turn some of its showrooms in China into one-stop shops called “Tesla Centers” that also serve as delivery sites and offer maintenance support, two sources familiar with the matter said.
The sources cautioned that plans might change depending on the circumstances.
