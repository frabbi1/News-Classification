Japanese car giant Toyota on Thursday reported record net profit and sales for the first half, with cost-cutting efforts helping to boost its balance sheet.
The maker of the Camry sedan and Prius hybrid reported net profit rose 2.6 percent to 1.27 trillion yen ($11.7 billion) in April-September.
The company kept its full-year net profit forecast at 2.15 trillion yen and operating profit at 2.4 trillion yen on sales of 29.5 trillion yen, though it made a minor change to its forecast for pre-tax profit.
Factors including cost reductions and marketing helped outweigh negative impacts from foreign currency exchange rates, contributing to a 11.3 percent rise in operating profit, or 1.4 trillion yen for the six months to September, Toyota said in a statement.
