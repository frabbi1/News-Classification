The cows of Qatar's Baladna farm, housed in climate-controlled farms in the desert, exemplify the lengths to which Qatar has gone to resist what it calls an economic "blockade" enforced by its Saudi-led neighbours.
"We were driven to do this by our commitment to provide Qatar with a fresh and steady supply of dairy products," said Baladna farm's vice-chairman Ramez al-Khayyat.
The company now meets more than 90 percent of the country's fresh dairy needs from its farm 55 kilometres (35 miles) north of Doha.
Baladna stock will initially only be on offer to Qatari individuals and companies, but bosses are still hoping to raise around $390 million for three-quarters of the company's shares.
