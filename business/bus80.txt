Euro zone retail sales accelerated more than expected year-on-year in September, data from the European Unionâ€™s statistics office showed on Wednesday, pointing to sustained domestic demand in Europe.
Eurostat said retail sales in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.1 percent month-on-month for a 3.1 percent year-on-year gain, up from 2.7 percent in August.
Retail sales are a proxy for domestic demand, which has been supported by unemployment at 11-year lows and gradual wage growth.
The statistics office said that month-on-month retail sales of food, drinks and tobacco fell 0.4 percent, but rose 0.1 percent for non-food products.
In year-on-year terms, which are less prone to swings, sales of food rose 1.3 percent and of non-food products by 4.6 percent, accelerating from 4.2 percent the previous month.
