A barrage of rate cuts from the Reserve Bank of India this year - five reductions in succession for a total of 135 basis points off the repo rate, now at 5.15 percent - has done nothing concrete so far to revive a slowing Indian economy.
“Stable portfolio flows led by equities and global cues like trade negotiations, on top of rate cuts, have led to bouts of optimism.
Currency speculators have cut short bets on the rupee to the lowest since mid-August, a separate Reuters poll showed.
The rupee’s outlook was also driven by renewed interest among foreign portfolio investors for Indian assets.
They bought 160.69 billion rupees of Indian securities in October, the highest in six months, according to Foreign Portfolio Investors’ data.
