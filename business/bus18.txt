With thousands of workers painstakingly handmaking vast volumes of firecrackers, Sivakasi in southern India is usually at full tilt before Diwali.
Just before Diwali last year, India's top court ruled only "green crackers" that emit fewer pollutants could be used.
But although the police tried to enforce the new rules, most people set off the old type regardless.
Confusion still surrounds the regulations, but signs in Sivakasi district, which in past years supplied 90-95 percent of India's firecrackers with revenues of around $800 million, suggest the 2019 blowout will be quieter.
G Karuppasamy, 65, a Sivakasi firecracker shopkeeper and wholesaler, told AFP that sales have slumped almost 50 percent as orders from around India have dried up.
