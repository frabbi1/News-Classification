President Xi Jinping on Tuesday pledged to further open China's economy, declaring the world must "tear down walls" as he opened an annual trade fair in Shanghai.
The world community must "continue to knock down walls instead of building walls, resolutely oppose protectionism and unilateralism, (and) continuously reduce trade barriers", Xi said.
With China and the US working to lock in a partial trade deal announced last month, Xi steered clear of the tariff war in his remarks.
Xi also said he hoped a China-backed proposed regional trade deal could be signed soon, a day after it was dealt a blow by India's withdrawal.
"I hope the agreement will be signed and entered into force at an early date," Xi said in Shanghai.
