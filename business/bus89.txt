Trade deficit narrowed slightly in the first quarter of the fiscal year as both exports and imports declined, a development that can be construed as symptoms of an economic slowdown.
Between the months of July and September, trade deficit, a situation when imports exceed exports, stood at $3.71 billion, down 3.50 percent year-on-year, according to data from the central bank.
Along with trade deficit, current account deficit also decreased 48.48 percent year-on-year to $678 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019-20.
“A strong overall balance could even offset the large trade and current account deficit.” he said.
The reduced deficit in both trade balance and current account will not yield any positive results for the economy as the overall balance decreased alarmingly.
