Some 16 percent plan to introduce childcare facilities, while 61 percent have no plan yet, said the report “Tackling childcare: The business benefits and challenges of employer-supported childcare in Bangladesh”.
The IFC’s survey results point toward a strong business case for employer-supported childcare and incorporate recommendations for the private, public and development sectors to boost employer-supported childcare in the country.
According to Bangladesh Labour Law 2006, companies with more than 40 female employees are legally required to offer childcare options.
The IFC conducted the survey with the view to raising awareness that the benefits of employer-supported childcare outweigh the cost of implementing it.
Since 2017, the IFC has produced several reports on childcare, including from India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, highlighting the innovative approaches that companies have taken to provide childcare.
