China and the United States have agreed a plan to remove tariffs imposed on two-way goods in stages, the commerce ministry said Thursday, as negotiators try to hammer out a trade deal.
The two sides have been embroiled in a bruising trade war for more than a year, and have slapped punitive tariffs on hundreds-of-billions-of-dollars-worth of two-way trade.
But there has been growing hope that they are close to reaching a mini agreement as part of a wider deal.
Gao said if the two sides reached a phase-one agreement, tariffs should be rolled back "in the same proportion and simultaneously".
Trump noted that negotiations are "moving along" and "our deal's going along fine with China" but stressed repeatedly that he did not want to give more details until the agreement was finalised.
