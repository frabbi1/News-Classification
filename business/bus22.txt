India's credit rating at Baa2 is the second lowest investment rating and Moody's has warned that India could be heading for a debt trap and recessionary phase.
The negative outlook indicates that an upgrade is unlikely in the near term.
Moody's would likely change the rating outlook to stable if the likelihood that fiscal metrics would stabilize and improve over time increased significantly.
India's economic growth has slowed materially, with real and nominal GDP growth falling to 5 per cent and 8 per cent year on year in April-June 2019, respectively.
Moody's estimates that the growth slowdown is in part long-lasting.
