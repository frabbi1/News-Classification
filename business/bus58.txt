A week-long income tax fair will begin across the country on November 14, aiming to give the taxpayers a hassle-free environment to submit their tax returns and provide them with one-stop tax-related services.
The last date for the submission of income tax returns for individual taxpayers is November 30, which has been named ‘Tax Day’.
Since its inception, the income tax fair is gaining its popularity as it allows people to submit income tax returns at the quickest possible time without the hassle of visiting tax offices, said an NBR senior official.
"So, we request all to submit their income tax returns within the timeframe to avoid fine."
According to sources at the NBR, interest will be imposed on the income tax returns that will be submitted after November 30.
