Bangladesh has made remarkable progress by receiving more than 1 percent of total global production of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the first year after entering the LNG import marketplace.
“Bangladesh has astonished the world with its dramatic entry into the LNG market,” said Steven Kobos, president and managing director of Excelerate Energy, a US-based LNG company.
“To receive more than 1 percent of the total global LNG production in the first 12 months of operations is truly a remarkable achievement,” he said in a statement.
The event – “Bangla LNG Workshop 2019– Best Practices for LNG Market and Infrastructure – brought together more than 120 industry leaders from the public and private sectors to discuss the pertinent topics surrounding the global LNG industry and gas markets of Bangladesh.
Bangladesh joined the global LNG import marketplace through the delivery of the country’s first LNG import terminal—Moheshkhali Floating LNG—last year.
