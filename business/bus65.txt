The World Trade Organization said, on Friday, that China can impose tariffs on up to $3.6 billion worth of US goods over the American government's failure to abide by anti-dumping rules concerning Chinese products.
The decision means China can impose higher tariffs against the United States than China is currently allowed under WTO rules, and will be given leeway as to the U.S. products and sectors it would like to target.
That was a record award from a WTO arbitrator in the trade body's nearly quarter-century history.
In the Chinese anti-dumping ruling, the WTO faulted two techniques that the United States uses to set penalties for dumping.
The US and China have filed several complaints with the WTO against each others' tariffs, but dispute resolution can take years.
