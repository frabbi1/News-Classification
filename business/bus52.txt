10 countries announced here on Wednesday the opening of country flagship stores on Tmall, Alibaba's online marketplace, to cash in on Chinese consumers' rising appetite for imported goods.
Luis Schmidt, Chile's ambassador to China, said it is becoming increasingly easier to come to do business in China.
Tmall can get consumers to know not only cherry but other food items including milk, seafood, and beef from Chile, he said.
During the second CIIE, 113 new brands will open stores on Tmall for the first time, according to Tmall.
Over the past half-year, more than 10,000 brands from all over the world have opened Tmall stores to reach Chinese consumers.
