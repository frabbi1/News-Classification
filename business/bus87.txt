The factory management also accepts lower prices in the hope of price hike and profit in future, he said.
The effects of selling the garment items at prices lower than the production costs are more dangerous.
Only 13 percent of the buyers who source from Bangladesh increased the prices of garment items after the minimum wage hike in 2013.
Between 2011 and 2016, the overall prices of Bangladeshi garment items declined 7.79 percent.
Fazlee Shamim Ehsan, director of BKMEA, said nothing is changing although the manufacturers are complaining of the low prices of garment items for long.
