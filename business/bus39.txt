After a career breaking glass ceilings to join a tiny global elite, Christine Lagarde will bring experience of cool-headed crisis fighting to her job as first female head of the European Central Bank.
But Lagarde, unused to failure, "knows perfectly well what she has to do" at the ECB, departing chief Mario Draghi said Thursday.
Beginning as trade minister, Lagarde ascended to the economy portfolio two years later, just before the 2008 financial crisis and global recession.
When a new IMF chief was needed after former chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn's sexual assault scandal, she made the leap.
Lagarde attempted to learn from the Greece crisis in dealings with Argentina, placing responsibility for reforms firmly on Buenos Aires' shoulders.
