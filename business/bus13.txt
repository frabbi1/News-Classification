China's President Xi Jinping (R) and French President Emmanuel Macron (L) visit France's pavilion during the China International Import Expo in Shanghai on november 5, 2019.
The world community must "continue to knock down walls instead of building walls, resolutely oppose protectionism and unilateralism, (and) continuously reduce trade barriers", Xi said.
Speaking after Xi, Macron complained that the US-China trade war "only creates losers" and was weighing on global growth.
But the French leader also said China's market opening "must be speeded up and made more transparent".
Xi repeated past pledges to offer greater market access, protect intellectual property rights and improve the legal framework for foreign enterprises.
