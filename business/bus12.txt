A three-day trade conference titled ‘Australia-Bangladesh Trade Conference, 2019’ will be held in Sydney on November 13-15 to further strengthen the growing Bangladesh-Australia trade links.
The trade conference will bring together businesses, investors and government leaders from Bangladesh and Australia to discuss ways to enhance trade and investment opportunities.
The Bangladesh High Commission in Canberra and the Australia-Bangladesh Business Council Bangladesh will jointly organise the event.
Australian High Commissioner to Bangladesh Julia Niblett had a discussion with Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi recently ahead of his visit to Australia for the Australia-Bangladesh Trade Conference.
“I’m pleased that the governments of Australia and Bangladesh are working together to further enhance the trade relationship,” said Niblett.
