Tannery village, the second of its kind across the country will be set up in Mirsarai Economic Zone (MEZ) under Bangabandhu Shilpa Nagari (BSN) ‘industrial city’ belt in the near future.
MEZ has awarded allocation nearly 300 acres of land from BSN for locating the proposed tannery village.
Bangladesh Small & Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC) sources told that government has decided to establish two tannery villages across the country after Savar tannery zone.
One will be built at Rajshahi and the second one at Mirsarai, Chattogram.
Alam said 30 to 40 per cent raw hides are collected from Chattogram and establishment of modern tannery industries is most essential for earning desired foreign currency from this sector.
