AFP photoRiyadh has an “open channel” with Yemen’s Iran-backed rebels with the goal of ending the country’s civil war, a Saudi official said yesterday, weeks after the rebels offered to halt attacks on the kingdom.
“We have had an open channel with the Huthis since 2016.
We are continuing these communications to support peace in Yemen,” a senior Saudi official told reporters.
Washington too is in talks with the Huthis, Assistant Secretary of Near Eastern Affairs David Schenker said during a visit to Saudi Arabia in September.
He did not say whether the Americans were holding talks separately with the rebels, but analysts say they were likely happening in consultation with Saudi Arabia, a key ally of Washington.
