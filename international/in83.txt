Hindus and Muslims have for decades been bitterly divided over the 16th-century Babri mosque in Ayodhya, a city in the northern Uttar Pradesh state that Hindus believe is the birthplace of their god Ram.
“Thousands of (additional) security personnel from different agencies have been deployed in and around Ayodhya.
Additional vehicles, CCTV cameras, body cameras and drones too have been brought in,” Ayodhya police senior superintendent Ashish Tiwari told AFP Wednesday.
Ayodhya -- considered one of the holiest Hindu sites -- is visited by religious pilgrims from all over India throughout the year.
“We just have to stay alert and sensitive to the security of the visiting pilgrims,” Ayodhya district magistrate Anuj Kumar Jha told AFP.
