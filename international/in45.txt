The first open impeachment hearings into US president Donald Trump will begin next week, the congressman leading the probe said Wednesday, as the investigation heads into a highly anticipated public phase.
Schiff has already begun releasing transcripts of private witness testimony but it is widely believed that the trio's appearance at public hearings could have a more dramatic impact on the American public.
Trump loyalists in Congress have been disparaging the impeachment process, as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy sought to do after Schiff's announcement.
Public hearings are not the same as FAIR hearings," McCarthy tweeted.
Democrats summoned the highest-ranking White House official yet, acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, to testify this week, although he is highly likely to refuse.
