Finland's 'national envy day', when tax details of the country's top earners are made public, was mired in controversy on Monday as a new law allowed some individuals to hide their earnings from the media.
The Nordic country has a tradition of earnings transparency, with citizens' income for the previous year -- and crucially, how much tax they paid -- published in the media at the start of November.
Public tax data is seen by many Finns as an important marker of the country's commitment to equality and welfare.
Noora Kontro, senior advisor at Finland's tax administrator, said that the office agreed to the 200 withholding requests for "economic, social or health and security-related reasons".
Based on data made public, Finland's highest earners last year were two founders of the games company Supercell, Ilkka Paananen and Mikko Kodisoja, who pocketed 109 million euros and 98 million euros, respectively.
