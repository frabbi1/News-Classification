The United States is unsafe for would-be refugees and a Canada-US agreement that compels asylum seekers to first apply for US sanctuary ought to be ripped up, lawyers for refugees and rights groups argued in a Canadian federal court on Monday.
Under the Safe Third Country Agreement, asylum seekers at a formal Canada-US border crossing travelling in either direction are turned back and told to apply for asylum in the country they first arrived in, reports Reuters.
Lawyers for unnamed refugees who had been turned away are challenging the agreement, saying the United States does not qualify as a “safe” country under President Donald Trump.
Some asylum seekers have told Reuters they might have stayed in the United States had it not been for Trump’s immigration rhetoric and policies.
On Monday, the plaintiff’s lawyers said Canada had failed to adequately review the United States’ status as a safe country.
