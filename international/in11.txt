The EU said yesterday it was “deeply concerned” by an incident involving an inspector with the UN’s nuclear watchdog last week in Iran which led to her having her accreditation cancelled.
The woman left Iran on October 30, Gharib Abadi said, after what he described as her “hasty summoning” back to Vienna.
Iran has been progressively scaling back its commitments under a landmark 2015 deal aimed at reining in Tehran’s nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief.
The IAEA, which has not publicly commented on the incident with the inspector so far, monitors the deal’s implementation.
Gharib Abadi has denied the inspector was ever detained, saying she was allowed to leave the country despite ongoing investigations into the incident.
