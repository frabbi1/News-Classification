Iran's atomic energy agency said its Fordow plant would begin enriching uranium from midnight.
Iran had announced Tuesday that it would resume uranium enrichment at the underground plant south of Tehran.
French president Emmanuel Macron said Iran had made "grave" decisions and its resumption of uranium enrichment was a "profound change" from Tehran's previous position.
German foreign minister Heiko Maas said Iran must roll back its decision to resume uranium enrichment, calling Tehran's action "unacceptable".
"We have always fully implemented our commitments and Iran must now urgently relent in order to ease tensions."
