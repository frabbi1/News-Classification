At least three women and six children from an American Mormon community in northern Mexico have been killed in an ambush in an area notorious for drug traffickers and bandits, a relative said.
The government deployed the army to fight drug trafficking in 2006, but experts blame the so-called "drug war" for the spiraling violence between fragmented cartels and the military, which has lead to more than 250,000 murders.
"It was a massacre," Lebaron, an activist who has denounced criminal groups in the area, told Formula Radio.
The community are descendants of Mormons who fled the US in the nineteenth century after being persecuted for their traditions, including polygamy.
Many Mormons in Mexico enjoy dual Mexican and American citizenship and -- according to Mexican media -- the Lebaron family asked for the help of the US embassy.
