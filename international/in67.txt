Billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg is strongly considering entering the race for the US Democratic Party's presidential nomination.
The ex-New York City mayor is concerned the current field of candidates is not good enough to beat Donald Trump in the 2020 election, his adviser says.
The 77-year-old is expected to file paperwork this week for the Democratic presidential primary in Alabama.
Former Vice-President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders are the frontrunners.
So far, three Republicans have said they will challenge Mr Trump in the party's primary contest.
