Relatives of an Indian woman who married outside her caste and fled her home to escape punishment stoned her and her husband to death after the couple returned to their village to visit family, police said Thursday.
But they returned to the village last month to meet family members.
The incident is the latest in a string of so-called "honour killings" which are rampant in rural pockets of the country.
They are typically carried out by close relatives or village elders to protect what is seen as the family's reputation in a rigid caste system.
India's Supreme Court ruled in 2011 that those found guilty of such killings should face the death penalty.
