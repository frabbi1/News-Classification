The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees has resigned amid an internal probe into alleged mismanagement and ethical abuses at the organization, the United Nations said Wednesday.
The report describes "credible and corroborated" allegations of serious ethical abuses, including ones involving Krahenbuhl, a Swiss national.
The agency confirmed Wednesday that its internal probe had so far "revealed management issues which relate specifically to the commissioner general."
Krahenbuhl's resignation comes as the UN General Assembly is due to renew UNRWA's mandate for another three years, despite fierce opposition from the United States, which considers it to be inadequate.
The agency disputes that and says the services it provides would otherwise not be available to Palestinians.
