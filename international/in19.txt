Nabaneeta Dev Sen once said she took up the pen because there was no escape for her as “everybody who came to our house, was a writer”.
Dev Sen joined the comparative literature department of Jadavpur University, from where she retired as a professor in 2002.
Dev Sen gave credit to her parents.
Dev Sen researched for years on “Ramkatha”, playing a pioneering role in analysing it from Sita's point of view.
But with her advanced years, realisation dawned on Dev Sen that life is not a fairy tale.
