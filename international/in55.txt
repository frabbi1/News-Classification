Brazil's top court has voted to overturn a rule about the jailing of criminals - a change which could lead to ex-President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva being freed from custody.
The ruling, announced on Thursday, stipulates that convicted criminals should go to prison only after they have exhausted their appeal options.
He was favourite to win last year's presidential election but was imprisoned after being implicated in a major corruption investigation.
It overturns a three-year-old ruling which threatened suspects with immediate prison time before their appeals were exhausted.
The measure was seen as helping prosecutors secure convictions and unravel the major corruption probe by encouraging suspects to negotiate plea deals.
