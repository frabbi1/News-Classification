Australian authorities say an "unprecedented" number of emergency-level bushfires are threatening the state of New South Wales (NSW).
Gusty winds and up to 35C heat have exacerbated the fires, many of which are in drought-affected areas.
At one point, 17 emergency-level fires were burning simultaneously across NSW.
Some people were warned to seek shelter from fires rather than flee, as it was now too late to leave.
Emergency warnings were also issued on Friday for bushfires burning in Queensland and Western Australia.
