More than 80 farmers have been arrested in northern India for starting fires that contributed to the recent pollution crisis in New Delhi and other cities, officials said Thursday.
A senior Punjab police officer said more than 17,000 farm fires had been reported in the state in the past three days, with 4,741 on Wednesday alone.
Punjab and Haryana make up a key agricultural region that produces nearly 18 million tonnes of rice each year.
Tiny particles from the fires, which can enter the bloodstream and penetrate the lungs and heart, get blown over New Delhi.
"Administration is already on high alert and have tasked them to escalate actions against crop burning and other factors that contribute to smog," he said.
