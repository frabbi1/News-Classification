Violent hate speech targeting religious and ethnic minorities on Facebook in Assam, India, has been viewed at least 5.4 million times, a new investigation has shown.
The NRC process has prompted repeated warnings from the UN that there was rising hate speech against vulnerable minorities in Assam.
Despite this, Facebook has relied heavily on artificial intelligence (AI) hate speech detection mechanisms that have failed to identify hate speech stoking up ethnic tensions in Assam, and has so far refused to put in place adequate human-led teams urgently needed to detect hate speech in Assam.
The Indian government should show how it is enforcing its laws to investigate and prosecute hate speech, with a particular focus on protecting minorities.
The UN should engage social media companies on how they protect vulnerable minorities, and address hate speech and disinformation.
