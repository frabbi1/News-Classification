Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (L) held talks with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on a visit to EU member Hungary repeated his threat Thursday to "open the gates" for millions of refugees eager to flee to Europe unless more international support was provided.
Erdogan has called on EU countries to provide more financial support for his plan to create the "safe zone".
If we open the gates, it is obvious where they will go," Erdogan added.
At a meeting in Kazakhstan last month, Erdogan personally thanked Orban for his "support" for Ankara's Syrian operation.
