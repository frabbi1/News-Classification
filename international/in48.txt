International Criminal Court Judges will on Thursday sentence Congolese rebel chief Bosco "Terminator" Ntaganda after he was convicted earlier this year of war crimes and sexual slavery.
He became the first person to be found guilty of sexual slavery when he was convicted by The Hague-based ICC in July.
In total he was convicted on 13 counts of war crimes and five of crimes against humanity.
The ICC judges heard separately from victims and witnesses in September to help them decide on the sentence.
The first-ever suspect to voluntarily surrender to the ICC, Ntaganda walked into the US embassy in the Rwandan capital Kigali in 2013 and asked to be sent to the court in the Netherlands.
