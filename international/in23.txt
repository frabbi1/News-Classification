French President Emmanuel Macron said he believed NATO was undergoing "brain death," lamenting a lack of coordination between Europe and the United States and unilateral action in Syria by key member Turkey, in an interview published Thursday.
"What we are currently experiencing is the brain death of NATO," Macron told The Economist magazine.
"You have no coordination whatsoever of strategic decision-making between the United States and its NATO allies.
Macron said that while "it's not in our interest" to expel Turkey from NATO -- as has been urged by some politicians -- members states should "reconsider what NATO is."
"He's quite close to our views and has a key intellectual and political role" in central Europe, said Macron.
