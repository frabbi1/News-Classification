AFP PhotoAn earthquake rocked northwestern Iran before dawn yesterday, killing at least five people and injuring more than 300 in crumbling and collapsed buildings.
The 5.9-magnitude quake struck at 1:17 am (2247 GMT Thursday) about 120 kilometres (75 miles) southeast of the city of Tabriz, in East Azerbaijan province, the Iranian Seismological Centre said.
Described as “moderate”, the quake was eight kilometres (five miles) deep and was followed by five aftershocks.
Some 40 homes were levelled by the quake and over 200 head of cattle killed.
The quake was felt in the provincial capital Tabriz and as far away as the city of Rasht, near the Black Sea coast 200 kilometres (125 miles) from the epicentre.
