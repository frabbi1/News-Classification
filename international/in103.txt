A New York judge has ordered President Donald Trump to pay $2m (£1.6m) for misusing funds from his charity to finance his 2016 political campaign.
Charities such as the one Mr Trump and his three eldest children headed cannot engage in politics, the judge ruled.
Ms James said Mr Trump had admitted to "personally misusing funds at the Trump Foundation".
Donald Trump Jr, Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump - who were also directors of the Trump Foundation - are required to undergo mandatory training "on the duties of officers and directors of charities", Ms James said.
The case was opened following an investigation into the Trump Foundation by the Washington Post in 2016.
