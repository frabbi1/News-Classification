New Zealand’s plan to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 became law yesterday, when it cleared its final hurdle in parliament.
The legislation, which was supported on both sides of the political divide, mandates that, in net terms, the country should produce no greenhouse gases -- except methane -- by the middle of the century, as part of New Zealand’s bid to meet its Paris climate accord commitments.
Methane -- a by-product of the key agricultural sector -- will be cut by 24-47 percent over the same time frame.
