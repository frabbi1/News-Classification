A New York judge on Thursday ordered Donald Trump to pay USD 2 million for using his former charity to further his political and business interests, adding to the president’s legal woes.
Trump agreed to shut down his personal charity in December but the suit moved ahead regardless as prosecutors sought millions of dollars in restitution and penalties.
It also said that in early 2016 while Trump was running for president, he organized what was billed as a Trump Foundation fundraiser but was actually a campaign event.
Trump accused James of “deliberately mischaracterizing this settlement for political purposes,” and said the resolution of the case was not damaged, but simply donations to the charities.
“Every penny of the USD19 million raised by the Trump Foundation went to hundreds of great charitable causes with almost no expenses,” he said in a statement.
