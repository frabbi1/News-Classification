A magnitude 5.9 earthquake struck northwestern Iran early Friday, killing at least five people and injuring more than 300 others, officials said.
The quake injured at least 312 people, state television reported, though only 13 needed to be hospitalized.
The head of Iran’s emergency medical services, Pirhossein Koulivand, gave the casualty figures to state television.
Rescuers have been dispatched to the region, officials said.
A magnitude 7 earthquake that struck western Iran in 2017 killed more than 600 people and injured more than 9,000.
