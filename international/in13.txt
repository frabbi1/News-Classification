From the White House, President Donald Trump has fought several lawsuits from women who say they had sexual interactions with him before he took office.
Trump denies the women's claims of both unwanted and consensual encounters, sometimes followed by what the women call defamatory statements about them.
In response, Trump said in a series of statements and interviews that she was "totally lying" to get publicity for her book.
Carroll's lawsuit says Trump's statements were false and cost the longtime Elle magazine columnist the goodwill of many readers.
Trump attorney Charles Harder called the ruling "total victory for President Trump and total defeat for Stormy Daniels."
