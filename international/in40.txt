A top ally of president Donald Trump admitted he told a Ukraine official that US military aid was contingent on Kiev investigating Trump’s Democratic rival Joe Biden, testimony released Tuesday showed.
“I presumed that the aid suspension had become linked to the proposed anti-corruption statement” Zelensky was told to make regarding Biden and 2016 probes.
Other witnesses have said that Mulvaney was responsible for freezing the Ukraine aid in mid-July, and that he told others it was done at Trump’s command.
They also describe Giuliani as being Trump’s point man for pushing Zelensky’s government into finding dirt on Biden and the Democrats.
“He just kept saying: talk to Rudy, talk to Rudy,” Sondland said of a May meeting with Trump on Ukraine.
