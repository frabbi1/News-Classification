The UN General Assembly on Thursday condemned the nearly 60-year-old US embargo on Cuba for the 28th year in a row, calling for an end to it by a vote of 187 to three.
In 2016, the US abstained for the first time in the annual UN vote amid a historic rapprochement with Cuba under former president Barack Obama.
Havana claims the embargo has caused $138 billion in damage to the island's economy, in today's dollars.
Brazilian foreign minister Ernesto Araujo said its decision to vote against Cuba was based on the need to combat communism.
"The influence that Cuba has over developing countries within the UN system is an embarrassment and should be stopped," Araujo said.
