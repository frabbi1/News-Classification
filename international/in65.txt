The Gandhi family will no longer have Special Protection Group (SPG) cover, the Indian government has decided, according to home ministry sources.
The SPG, an elite force of 3,000, are now tasked with protecting only Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Z Plus security means the Gandhis will be guarded by around 100 personnel of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF).
In August, the government had withdrawn former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's SPG cover.
Mr Vajpayee had SPG cover till he died in 2018.
