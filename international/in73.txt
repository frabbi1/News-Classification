Two North Korean fishermen suspected of killing 16 fellow crew members before fleeing to the South have been handed back to the North.
They crossed the maritime border on Saturday and were later detained by authorities in the South.
South Korea usually grants asylum to defectors but said that in this case, the two men posed a threat to national security.
After crossing the border on their squid fishing boat, it took two days for the South Korean navy to seize them.
The two men in their 20s were handed over to the North at the border village of Panmunjom in the demilitarised zone, he said.
