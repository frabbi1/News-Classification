The Iranian army shot down an unidentified drone near the port of Bandar-e Mahshahr on the Gulf coast yesterday, Iran’s semi-official ISNA news agency reported.
Trump in June authorised a military strike after Iran shot down a US drone, only to call off the retaliation at the last moment.
Washington insists the aircraft was in international airspace, but Iran says it was over its territorial waters.
Yemen’s Iran-backed Huthi rebels claimed responsibility, but the US says the attacks involved cruise missiles from Iran and amounted to “an act of war”.
Washington has responded with a military build-up in the Gulf and on Thursday launched an operation with its allies to protect navigation in Gulf waters.
