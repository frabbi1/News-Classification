Bosco Ntaganda looks on in the courtroom of the ICC ahead of his verdictA former Congolese rebel leader has been sentenced to 30 years for war crimes and crimes against humanity.
Judges at the International Criminal Court (ICC) found in July that fighters loyal to Ntaganda had carried out gruesome massacres of civilians.
Ntaganda was a "key leader" who gave orders to "target and kill civilians", Judge Fremr said in the ruling.
Several bodies were disembowelled or otherwise mutilated," Judge Fremr said.
A fifth person, Jean-Pierre Bemba, the former vice-president of DR Congo, was initially found guilty of war crimes before being cleared on appeal last year.
