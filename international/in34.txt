NATO partners argued Thursday over the alliance's worth after French president Emmanuel Macron said it was undergoing "brain death", prompting a fierce defence of the bloc from Germany, Canada and the US while drawing praise from non-member Russia.
"What we are currently experiencing is the brain death of NATO," Macron told The Economist magazine in an interview published Thursday, ahead of a NATO summit next month.
Addressing journalists by Merkel's side, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg warned that a weakened transatlantic alliance could "divide Europe", while the US Secretary of State, also in Germany, insisted NATO was "important, critical."
After talks with Stoltenberg in Berlin, Merkel said Macron "used drastic words, that is not my view of cooperation in NATO".
From Moscow, foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova hailed Macron's "brain death" observation as "golden words... a precise definition of the current state of NATO".
