Two former employees of Twitter have been charged in the US with spying for Saudi Arabia.
The charges, unsealed on Wednesday in San Francisco, allege that Saudi agents sought personal information about Twitter users including known critics of the Saudi government.
A third person, Saudi citizen Ahmed Almutairi, is also accused of spying.
The charges allege Mr Almutairi acted as an intermediary between the two Twitter employees and Saudi officials.
Mr Alzabarah, a former Twitter engineer, is accused of accessing the personal data of more than 6,000 Twitter users in 2015 after being recruited by Saudi agents.
