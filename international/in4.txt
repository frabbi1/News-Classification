A “tsunami” of political disinformation is pounding Facebook users with the US presidential election still a year away, online activist network Avaaz said in a report released yesterday.
An analysis by the NGO of the top 100 bogus news stories about US politics that went viral on Facebook in the 10 months ending October 31 showed that politically tinged false news got more than 158 million views.
“These findings can only be seen as the tip of the iceberg of disinformation ahead of the US 2020 elections,” Avaaz said in the report.
Avaaz only looked at stories that were fact-checked and debunked by reputable fact-checking organizations.
“The 2020 elections are at risk,” said Avaaz campaign director Fadi Quran.
