A lone attacker on Wednesday stabbed eight people, including four foreign tourists and their tour guide, at a popular archaeological site in northern Jordan, official state-run media said.
The reports quoted an unnamed security official as saying the wounded included three Mexican tourists and a Swiss woman.
Along with the tour guide, three other Jordanians, including a policeman, were also hurt before the attacker was subdued and arrested, reports said.
Jordan's economy relies heavily on tourism, and Islamic militant groups have in the past targeted tourist sites.
A 2016 attack by the Islamic State group killed 14 people, including a Canadian tourist.
