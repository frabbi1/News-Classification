With the Supreme Court verdict in the Ayodhya case expected in the next few days, prime minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday stressed the need for maintaining peace and harmony in the country and asked his ministerial colleagues to avoid any controversial comments on it.
Modi, while chairing a meeting of his Council of Ministers, took stock of the situation prevailing in the country.
Everyone, including the government, had the responsibility to maintain peace and harmony, while avoiding provocation, he said.
This is the second time in the past 10 days that the prime minister spoke on the need to maintain peace on the Ayodhya issue.
In his 27 October 'Mann ki Baat' radio programme, he cited the example how all sections had accepted the Allahabad High Court verdict in the case in 2010.
