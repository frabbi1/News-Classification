Cyclonic storm ‘Bulbul’ is likely to hit Bangladesh coast at any time on Saturday, an official of Bangladesh Meteorological Department said on Friday.
“We cannot tell the exact time when Bulbul will hit.
But the cyclone does not change its direction, it may hit the Bangladesh coast anytime tomorrow,” meteorologist Shanana Sultana told media at 12 noon.
She said Bulbul was still 700 kilimetres away from the Bangladesh coast and was advancing towards Bangladesh and India’s West-Bengal.
“Bulbul” was over east-central bay and adjoining area, moved north-northwestwards over the same area and was centred at 6 am about 760 km south-southwest of Chattogram port, 710 km south-southwest of Cox’s Bazar port, 665 km south of Mongla port and 650 km south of Payra port,” the release said.
