A total of 96 more Bangladeshi workers were deported from Saudi Arabia on Wednesday night, reports UNB.
Another deportee Mohuddin said he had been in Saudi Arabia for three years.
But he had to return with empty hand in spite of having valid documents, he alleged.
He said although he has all valid documents, police picked him up from a road of the country and sent him back.
Workers think that their stay in Saudi Arabia is legal if they have Iqama (work permit).
