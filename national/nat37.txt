Talking to reporters before the janaza, senior Awami League leader Tofail Ahmed recalled the contributions of Khoka to the country’s Liberation War.
“We all have flaws in our lives, but Sadeque Hossain Khoka was an amicable person and a gentleman.”BNP standing committee member Moudud Ahmed said Khoka was an acceptable politician to all.
Ishraque, however, thanked the government for extending cooperation to them in taking Khoka’s body back home.
The family members of the BNP leader, including his wife Ismat Ara, also returned home in the same flight.
After his Janza at Nagar Bhaban, Khoka’s body will be taken to his Gopibagh residence.
