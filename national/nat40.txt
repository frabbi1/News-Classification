Myanmar again applied for the IORA membership this year and some of the Southeast Asian countries supported its application.
However, Bangladesh opposed the membership application at the 21st IORA Council of Senior Officials’ (CSO) meeting held in Abu Dhabi of the United Arab Emirates on 5-6 November.
Bangladesh also presented the report on the Third IORA Blue Economy Ministerial Conference which took place in Dhaka on 4-5 September.
The CSO meeting was followed by the 19th Council of Ministers’ Meeting (COMM) held on Thursday.
During the CSO meeting, vice chairmanship for the tenure of October 2019-October 2021 was officially handed over to Bangladesh.
