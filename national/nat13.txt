A favourable atmosphere needs to be created in Myanmar for the voluntary, safe and dignified repatriation of Rohingyas to Rakhine state, said the US acting Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asian Affairs Alice Wells here on Thursday.
“The repatriation must be voluntary, safe and dignified,” she said while speaking at a press briefing at the office of the Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner after visiting Shamlapur Rohingya camp in Teknaf Upazila.
Alice said the US has been working with all international communities for accelerating the Rohingya repatriation while the issue was prioritised in the Indo-Pacific conference in Thailand.
Bangladesh is hosting over 1.1 million Rohingyas and most of them entered Cox’s Bazar since August 25, 2017 amid military crackdown on Rohingyas in Rakhine State.
Not a single Rohingya was repatriated over the last two years due to Myanmar’s “failure” to build confidence among Rohingyas and lack of conducive environment in Rakhine state, officials here said.
