A total of 39 illegal Bangladeshi immigrants were arrested in the western Libyan city of Zuwara on Thursday, the city's security department said.
"After receiving information about a site in eastern Zuwara suspected to be used to gather illegal immigrants, a patrol was immediately assigned to the scene.
Upon arrival, 39 illegal immigrants of Bangladeshi nationality were found," the department said in a statement on late Thursday.
The arrested immigrants were transferred to a shelter, the statement said.
The country has been mired in chaos and insecurity since the 2011 uprising that toppled late leader Muammar Gaddafi.
