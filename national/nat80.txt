A total of 11,000 foreign nationals living in Bangladesh from different countries including Africa without valid documents will be sent back to their respective countries with government cost.
Liberation War Affairs Minister AKM Mozammel Haque told journalists at a briefing after a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Law and Order at the home ministry conference room on Thursday.
He observed that foreign nationals are getting involved in various crimes.
He said the law enforcement agencies identified the foreign nationals whose visa validity expired and they have no money for traveling to their countries.
Meanwhile, the home minister urged house owners not to rent out their houses to foreign nationals without confirmation of their genuine addresses.
