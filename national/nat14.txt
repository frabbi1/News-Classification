Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday said the people, who are creating anarchy on universities after bringing corruption allegations against vice-chancellors, would have to face legal action if they fail to prove it.
If they can prove it action will be taken against them (VCs), otherwise, legal action will be taken against those making allegation,” she said while distributing assistance among journalists at a function at the Prime Minister’s Office in the capital.
The remarks came when unrests are going on over corruption allegations at Jahangirnagar University and Pabna University of Science and Technology (PUST).
The Prime Minister also requested the newsmen to publish follow-up stories about the agony of the thousands of women who were inhumanly tortured during the War of Liberation in 1971.
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina initiated the trust fund in 2014 by giving seed money of Taka 5 crore.
