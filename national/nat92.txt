Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina reiterated her stance on not allowing industries on arable lands.
The premier was inaugurating the 10th national council of Bangladesh Krishak League, an associate body of the ruling Awami League (AL), at the historic Suhrawardy Udyan in the city on Wednesday.
The government is going to stop building industries here and there to save arable land for the sake of ensuring food security for the 16 crore people, she argued.
Earlier, the AL chief inaugurated the national council of the Bangladesh Krihak League by releasing pigeons and balloons.
The premier called upon the leaders and workers of Awami League's associate body Krishak League to plant at least three saplings to save the environment from destruction.
