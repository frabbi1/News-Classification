Transparency International of Bangladesh (TIB) on Thursday recommended formation of an independent and neutral commission for the reform of banking sector 'riddled with corruption and irregularities'.
Citing the decision of forming a banking commission as a positive move, TIB executive director Iftekharuzzaman, in a press release, said the formation of a commission under Bangladesh Bank will be pointless.
"According to media reports, the government is going to form a commission under Bangladesh Bank for the banking sector reform.
If the commission is formed under Bangladesh Bank, it will create conflict of interests and hamper the objective, he added.
"We strongly believe that the government will realise the importance of the situation and form a neutral and independent commission as soon as possible," he added.
