The protesting students and teachers of Jahangirnagar University on Thursday continued their demonstrations on the campus defying ban as they pushed for the VC’s removal.
The protesters, under the banner of ‘JahangirnagarAgainst Corruption’, brought out a procession from the old Registrar Building around 1:30 pm following a rally.
At the rally, the protesting teachers criticized the statement of Deputy Minister for Education Mohibul Hasan Chowdhury Nowfel saying, “We aren’t from intelligence agencies.
On Wednesday night, the university authorities imposed a ban on the participation of non-resident students in any rally and procession on the campus.
On Tuesday, the university was closed for an indefinite period following a clash between protesting students and ‘VC-backed teachers and Chhatra League men’.
