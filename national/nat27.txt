A technical team of the UN agencies will visit Bhasan Char soon to assess the facilities and other relevant issues on relocation of Rohingyas there.
Representatives from the Rohingya community are likely to be taken during the planned visit, officials said.
About her meetings with the Bangladesh government officials, acting assistant secretary Wells stressed that the solution to the Rohingya crisis remains in Myanmar and condemned the inaction by Myanmar authorities to create conditions for voluntary, safe, and dignified returns, said the US Embassy in Dhaka on Thursday night.
The cluster in Bhasan Char comes with multi-storey buildings, a typical model that is hugely successful in coastal belt.
Deputy administrator Glick and acting assistant secretary Wells stressed the US governmentâ€™s commitment to stand with Bangladesh as it hosts over 1.1 million Rohingya community members.
