A favourable atmosphere needs to be created in Myanmar for the voluntary, safe and dignified repatriation of Rohingyas to Myanmar's Rakhine state, said US acting assistant secretary for South and Central Asian Affairs Alice Wells in Cox's Bazar on Thursday, reports UNB.
“The repatriation must be voluntary, safe and dignified,” she said while speaking at a press briefing at the office of the Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner after visiting Shamlapur Rohingya camp in Teknaf upazila.
Alice said the US has been working with all international communities for accelerating the Rohingya repatriation while the issue was prioritised in the Indo-Pacific conference in Thailand.
The host communities in Cox’s Bazar have been facing problems for the presence of Rohingyas, she added.
Bangladesh is hosting over 1.1 million Rohingyas and most of them entered Cox’s Bazar since 25 August, 2017 amid military crackdown on Rohingyas in Rakhine dtate.
