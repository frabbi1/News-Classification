Home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal on Thursday said the government has taken an initiative to deport around 11,000 foreigners staying in Bangladesh without valid documents.
The minister came up with the disclosure at the secretariat following a meeting of the cabinet committee on law and order, reports UNB.
Even the embassies of their respective countries in Dhaka did not respond when the authorities concerned contacted them to discuss the issue.
That is why the government has taken an initiative to send them back to their respective countries, he added.
The cabinet committee recommended allocation of some money in this regard, he added.
