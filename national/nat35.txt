Coming down heavily on those demonstrating demanding the removal of the vice chancellor of Jahangirnagar University, prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Thursday said they will have to face punishment if they fail to prove their allegations.
“If they fail to prove their allegations, they’ll be punished for bringing false accusations… we’ll definitely do this.
Sheikh Hasina said she has already directed the authorities concerned to keep the records and footages of speeches and words of everyone, who is bringing allegations.
I’ve made it clear,” said the prime minister.
I would like to say it unequivocally that those who are bringing graft allegation, they’ll have to prove their allegations and provide information.
