Bangladesh has banned allegedly a radical Islamist group, officials said, as the government steps up a crackdown against extremists.
The latest group to be banned is Allahr Dal, or the Party of Allah, with police alleging it was planning attacks.
Allahr Dal's leader Matin Mehedi was arrested in 2006 after he helped Jamayetul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), the nation's biggest militant group, carry out more than 400 small blasts across the nation in 2005.
Authorities believe the group, established in 1995, is an offshoot of JMB, which was banned after the blasts.
"They were planning to buy arms and weapons and to carry out raids to get their leader freed from jail."
