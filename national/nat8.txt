The United States has said it looks forward to the UN technical study of Bhasan Char, which will evaluate its "technical, security, and financial" feasibility to serve as an additional locale for Rohingyas.
A technical team of the UN agencies will visit Bhasan Char soon to assess the facilities and other relevant issues on relocation of Rohingyas there.
Representatives from the Rohingya community are likely to be taken during the planned visit, officials said.
The cluster in Bhasan Char comes with multistorey buildings, a typical model that is hugely successful in coastal belt.
The United States continues to call on others to join in contributing to this humanitarian response.
