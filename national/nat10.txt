Ninety six more Bangladeshi workers were deported from Saudi Arabia on Wednesday night.
Another deportee Mohuddin said he had been in Saudi Arabia for three years.
He said although he has all valid documents, police picked him up from a road of the country and sent him back.
Bracâ€™s migration head Shariful Hasan said a total of 21000 Bangladeshi workers have been deported this year.
Workers think that their stay in Saudi Arabia is legal if they have Iqama (work permit).
