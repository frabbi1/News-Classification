Talking to this correspondent, ACC lawyer Advocate Khurshid Alam Khan said that people submitted a huge number of allegations before the commission.
“The ignorance and lack of awareness regarding the ACC Act are the main reasons for the submission of flawed complaints.
The commission has no jurisdiction to conduct investigations into all cases, as stated by the ACC Act,” the senior ACC lawyer noted.
The ACC isan organisation that does not have the scope to take any legal action on complaints that were outside the schedule of the ACC Act, he added.
So, everyone must know a bit about the ACC Act before filing complaints, he stressed.
