The body of MP Mayeen Uddin Khan Badal is likely to be flown back home today.
A delegation of four members from Prime Minister's Office had gone to India to bring back the body along with Badal's family members.
Mayeen Uddin Khan Badal, elected MP of Chattogram-8 and acting Chair of National Socialist Party (JSD) partially, died on November 7 at Narayana Institute of Cardiac Sciences Hospital in Bengaluru.
SM Habib Babu, Badal's private assistant, told Kaler Kantho: "The body is reportedly to bring home on Friday morning.
The body will be taken to Boalkhali, his native village, after namaz-e-janaza at Bashundhara R/A and the south plaza of the parliament house respectively."
