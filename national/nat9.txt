A syndicate comprising three companies allegedly involved in laundering over Tk 1,100 crore in the guise of import and export business has been busted.
The CIID yesterday filed a total of 15 cases against these firms -- Agro BD, Henan & Anhui Agro and SB Exim Bangladesh -- for money laundering by generating fake bills amounting to about Tk.
However, the CIID said these factories practically existed on paper only and were used as fronts for money laundering.
According to sources, CIID received secret information that several fake firms were trying to get containers full of contrabands released at Chittagong port.
Sources concerned said Shahjahan Bablu, the MD of SB Exim Bangladesh, withdrew Tk.
