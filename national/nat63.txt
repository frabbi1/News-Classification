Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal said the government has taken an initiative to deport around 11,000 foreigners staying in Bangladesh without valid documents.
The minister came up with the disclosure on Thursday at the secretariat following a meeting of the cabinet committee on law and order.
The minister said the authorities enlisted around 11,000 foreigners who do not have valid visas or passports.
Even the embassies of their respective countries in Dhaka did not respond when the authorities concerned contacted them to discuss the issue.
That is why the government has taken an initiative to send them back to their respective countries, Asaduzzaman added.
