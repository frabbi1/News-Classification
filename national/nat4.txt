The Department of Shipping (DoS) has failed several times to register vessels plying illegally in the country due to the interference of local politicians.
According to DoS sources, there are around two lakh engine-driven boats, sand carriers, speedboats, bulkheads, trawlers and fishing boats without any registration in the country.
However, hundreds of owners across the country are illegally plying their vessels whose engines were between 20 to 60 horse powers, the sources said.
Asked about the number of unregistered vessels, the DoS chief replied, â€œIt is very difficult to say the exact number, but a significant number of vessels are plying in the country withoutregistration.
As a result, several hundreds of such vessels have been operating illegally and without safety equipment in the country.
