Foreign minister AK Abdul Momen on Thursday sought global support through "close partnership and collaboration" to achieve Bangladesh's development goals addressing challenges ahead, including a solution to the Rohingya crisis, according to UNB.
International affairs sub-committee of Bangladesh Awami League arranged the briefing for diplomats stationed in Dhaka.
The foreign minister described the challenges ahead, including climate change, and sought international community's support to address those challenges saying Bangladesh cannot do it alone.
He said Bangladesh seeks close partnership and collaboration from the global community as its resources are not adequate enough.
He said the longer stay of Rohingyas in Bangladesh might create pockets of radicalism posing threats to Bangladesh and beyond.
