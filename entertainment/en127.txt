Sophia Takal’s remake of the Canadian classic horror film, Black Christmas (1974), is ready for release under the same name.
Originally produced and directed by Bod Clark, the two and a half minute trailer of the 2019 remake was just released, and it seems more than just a slasher film.
With Imogen Poots (Riley Stone), Lily Donoghue (Marty), Aleyse Shannon (Kris) and Brittany O’Grady (Jesse) playing Hawthorne’s sorority sisters, and Caleb Eberhardt and Cary Elwes being spotted in the trailer, the stalker remains a mystery.
This recreation of terror and thrill is to hit the theatres on Friday the 13th of December, just before the Christmas bell rings!
