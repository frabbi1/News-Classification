Netflix recently released the teaser for the episode featuring Shah Rukh Khan on David Lettermanâ€™s My Next Guest Needs No Introduction.
As expected, the two celebrities rave about each other throughout the duration of the clip.
American talk show host David Letterman recently made a visit to Mumbai where he was hosted by King Khan at his house.
By the looks of it, Khan also cooked Italian food for Letterman.
Calling him the biggest star in the world, Letterman expressed what a blast he had getting to know Khan.
