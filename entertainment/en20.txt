From Chinese behemoths backed by the likes of Baidu to Southeast Asian upstarts offering free content, Asian video streaming services are challenging Western giants seeking to expand in the region.
"The whole landscape is changing," James Bridges, CEO and co-founder of documentary streaming service iwonder, which operates in Australia, New Zealand and Southeast Asia, told AFP.
The landscape is set become even more competitive with Disney and Apple poised to launch streaming platforms along the same subscription model as Netflix.
Meanwhile India, which does not restrict outside players to the same degree as China, has become a key battleground for streaming services.
Netflix and Amazon are however unlikely to snap up local streaming platforms unless they have a decent amount of local content in a big market, said MPA's Couto.
