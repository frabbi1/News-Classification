Popular musical group, Ghaashphoring Choir, launched their debut album, Kichu Kotha Kichu Gaan, last weekend.
Ghaashphoring Choir was founded by singer-songwriter and Berklee College of Music graduate, Armeen Musa, in 2015.
“Ghaashphoring Choir is a completely non-commercial project,” says Armeen.
The choir performed several tribute songs with the guest artistes and new songs from their debut album.
Dr Nashid Kamal has written Kichu Kotha Kichu Gaan, the title track of the album.
