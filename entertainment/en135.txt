According to reports that were widely circulated on the day after Diwali, Aishwarya’s publicist was rescued from a catastrophic accident by none other than Shah Rukh Khan who rushed to the lady’s rescue and doused the fire.
However, a very prominent guest at the Bachchan bash who was a first-hand witness to what transpired says Shah Rukh was nowhere in the picture, reports Bollywood Hungama.
“Archana Sadanand (Aishwarya’s publicist) was walking down the stairs when her dupatta caught fire in a deeya.
In no time at all her clothes were aflame.
It was Aishwarya who rushed and tore away the burning portion of Archana’s dupatta,” says the eyewitness.
