The heartbreaking testimony of one of France's most acclaimed actresses who said she was sexually harassed as a 12-year-old by the director of her first film has shaken France's film industry.
French film industry figures -- including Deneuve, who suffered a minor stroke Wednesday -- have also long defended the controversial director Roman Polanski.
But the big outpouring of support for Haenel may be turning France's more laissez-faire attitude on its head.
Oscar-winning French actress Marion Cotillard was one of the first to back Haenel, hailing her for "breaking a silence that was so heavy".
UniFrance, the official body that promotes French film abroad, also took the unusual step of publicly backing Haenel and said it is now drawing up a charter to protect actors.
