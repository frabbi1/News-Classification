The posts are making fans wonder if Preity has bagged a cameo in Salman’s film, Dabangg 3.
In the photos, Salman is seen in his Chulbul Pandey avatar from the Dabangg movies.
Next to him, Preity is seen in a cop’s uniform as well.
The navy uniform, however, means she is not playing an Indian cop in the film.
