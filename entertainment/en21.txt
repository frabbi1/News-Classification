A film festival in suburban Tokyo will show a documentary on the highly controversial issue of Japan's wartime military brothels, organisers said Sunday after coming under fire for dropping the movie.
The film's screening was cancelled last week after concerns over the safety of volunteers and objections from local officials.
The documentary "Shusenjo: The Main Battleground of The Comfort Women Issue" examines the debate over so-called "comfort women", who were forced to work in military brothels during World War II.
Mainstream historians say up to 200,000 women -- mostly from Korea, but also other parts of Asia including China -- were forced to work in the brothels.
But some nationalists insist the women were prostitutes, claiming there is no documented evidence that the Japanese military was ordered to recruit women against their will.
