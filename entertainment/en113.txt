I was in jail, but the choice was clear: this was an opportunity not to be missed,” says Shahidul Alam.
“In a time when free speech and expression is challenged in Bangladesh and across the world, Shahidul Alam’s lifelong work reveals the power of truth and voice in effecting change.
As shown by the global support for Alam across the art world, literary sphere, scholarly community, and humanitarian organisations during his recent period of incarceration in Dhaka, Shahidul Alam’s eminence cuts across fields.”As part of the exhibition, Shahidul Alam gave a talk yesterday at 6 pm (USA time) at the Rubin Museum of Art.
