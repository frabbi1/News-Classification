‘Hamlet’ and ‘Sonai Madhab’, two of the most popular plays in the country’s theatre arena, will be staged today at two separate venues of Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy (BSA) in Segun Bagicha of the capital.
BSA will bring ‘Hamlet’ on the stage at the National Theatre Hall at 7pm, while Loko Natyadal (Siddeshwari) will stage ‘Sonai Madhab’ at the Experimental Theatre Hall at the same time.
Originally written by William Shakespeare, the play ‘Hamlet’ has been translated and adapted by late writer Syed Shamsul Haq and directed by eminent director Ataur Rahman.
On the other hand, directed by Liaquat Ali Lucky, the production ‘Sonai Madhab’ is based on a story from Mymensingh Geetika—a collection of traditional ballads.
‘Sonai Madhab’ weaves a tale of romantic tragedy between Sonai and Madhab, the leading characters in the play.
