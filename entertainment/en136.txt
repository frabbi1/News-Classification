Deepika Padukone will play the central role of Draupadi in a retelling of the epic story of Mahabharat from the female perspective.
Deepika, who recently turned producer with her upcoming movie "Chhapaak", will produce the film in collaboration with Madhu Mantena.
"I'm absolutely thrilled and honoured to be essaying the role of Draupadi.
While the Mahabharat is popularly known for its mythological tales and cultural influence, many of life's lessons are also derived from the Mahabharat but most often from its men.
"Telling it with this fresh and new perspective will not only be interesting but also very significant," Deepika said in a statement.
