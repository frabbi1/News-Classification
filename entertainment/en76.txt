One of the surprises of 2019 is the emergence of Arekta Rock Band, a flamboyant act consisting of Riasat Azmi, Ifaz Abrar Reza, Arjo Biswas, Sakib Manzur Zihan and Raihan Mahbub Rasha.
After their first successful single, Shikari Aj Shikar, the band had recently released Eden, a song that crossed 20,000 views in about four days.
According to the band, the song is about “A reality you want to embrace and never want to let go, like when Adam and Eve stepped into the doorway of heaven”.
The song is available on YouTube and other online streaming platforms.
