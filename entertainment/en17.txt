Alongside her identity of an actress, Sonia Hossain has also earned admiration for her role of an anchor.
Because Sonia thinks she finds more comfort in anchoring in the recent scenario of the showbiz.
Considering her comfort zone in anchoring, Radio Aamar offered Sonia to host an exclusive show titled ‘Staying Alive with Sonia’.
The audience will also be able to enjoy Sonia’s new show on the Facebook page of Radio Aamar.
My sincere gratitude to the management of Radio Aamar for giving me an opportunity of anchoring such a wonderful show.”The show ‘Staying Alive with Sonia’ will be aired every Tuesday at the same time on Radio Aamar FM 88.4.
