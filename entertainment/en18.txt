An Israeli film released to coincide with the 24th anniversary of the assassination of former prime minister Yitzhak Rabin offers fresh insight into his killer -- and contemporary politics in Israel.
The killer opposed Rabin signing the Oslo autonomy accords with the Palestinians and the assassination dealt a serious blow to the peace process.
The film has also been selected to represent Israel at the Oscars in the best foreign film category.
One sequence shows Netanyahu at a right-wing protest in Jerusalem at which demonstrators brand Rabin a Nazi and traitor.
If the film shows Amir in his complexity, there is also no doubt about his guilt.
