The national anthem of Bangladesh has been given a Sanskrit makeover in the Indian state of Assam on the eighth death anniversary of Bhupen Hazarika, reports The Hindu.
Hazarika is a singer and cultural icon of Assam who died on November 5, 2011, at the age 85.
‘Aamaar Shonar Bangla’, the national anthem of Bangladesh, had been composed by Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore.
‘O Mor Aaapunaar Dekh’, the state anthem of Assam, has also been translated in to Sanskrit.
“’Amaar Shonar Bangla’ features in Anandini, the new Sanskrit album that Mr. Bezbaruah conceptualised, as ‘Ayee Swarnila Bangla’ while ‘O Mor Aaapunaar Dekh’ is ‘Aho Atmanah Desha’,” adds The Hindu report.
