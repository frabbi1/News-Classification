Amitabh Bachchan's journey of five decades to become the Bollywood 'Shahenshah' was not always a smooth ride.
The son of celebrated poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan started his journey as one of seven protagonists in the film, which didn't exactly mark a blockbuster debut.
The film, riding the powerful writing by Salim Khan and Javed Akthar, went on to usher the era of violence and intense drama in Bollywood cinema.
