A quarter century after grunge's enigmatic rhapsodist took his own life, Kurt Cobain's iconic cigarette-singed cardigan worn during Nirvana's 1993 "Unplugged" performance has sold for $334,000.
The tattered, olive-green, Manhattan-brand, button-up sweater, which has never been washed since Cobain wore it, came with dark stains and a burn hole.
"Kurt created the grunge look; he didn't wear show clothes," Julien told AFP at a New York exhibition preview.
The music cable channel MTV began its "Unplugged" series in 1989, recording live performances of acts that generally played their normally electrified music on sparse acoustics.
Cobain's left-handed Fender Mustang guitar, which he used during the band's "In Utero" tour, sold for $340,000.
