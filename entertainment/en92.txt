Released in 2007, Priyadarshan’s Bhool Bhulaiyaa starring Akshay Kumar, Vidya Balan, Paresh Rawal, Rajpal Yadav, Shiney Ahuja, Ameesha Patel and Manoj Joshi won over cinemagoers with its hilarious comedy shots and dialogues.
Twelve years later, actor Kartik Aaryan has announced the second instalment of the horror-comedy by revealing its first look on social media.
This means the audience will be missing Akshay Kumar’s sublime comedy timings as Kartik Aaryan will be playing the lead in Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2, directed by Anees Bazmee.
However, only time will tell whether he will be successful in not allowing the audience to miss Akshay Kumar in that role.
To be released on July 31, 2020, Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 is produced by Bhushan Kumar, Krishan Kumar and Murad Khetani.
