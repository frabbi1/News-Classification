“It’s never a bad thing to listen to one’s parents as their teachings never fail one in life,” says Bollywood super star Shah Rukh Khan.
It is unfortunate that you remember the teachings of your parents when they are not in your life,” Shah Rukh said in a statement.
The 53-year-old actor said he generally does not look for moral lessons in a film, but believes the story of Disney’s The Lion King is important because it talks about the precious bond between a parent and child.
The Lion King is scheduled to be released on July 19 in English, Hindi, Tamil and Telugu languages.
Shah Rukh, who along with his son Aryan will be voicing for King Mufasa and his son Simba, in the Hindi version of The Lion King believes one remembers the teachings of one’s parents only when they are gone.
