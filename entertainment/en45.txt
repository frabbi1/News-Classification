Thibault Cauvin, the only guitarist in the world to win 13 international awards and known as “the champion of classical guitar”, mesmerised the audience at National Theatre Hall of Shilpakala Academy in his first ever performance in Bangladesh on Tuesday.
Organised by Alliance Française de Dhaka, the programme was arranged in association with the support of the Embassy of France to Bangladesh, Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy, Oryx Bangladesh and Gandharbpur Water Treatment SNC (a joint venture of Suez International and OTV-Veolia), reports UNB.
He also played a surprise piece for the audience with Gazi Abdul Hakim, a renowned flautist of Bangladesh, at the end of the concert.
He has played in over 1000 solo concerts at prominent venues like New York’s Carnegie Hall, the Tchaikovsky Concert Hall in Moscow, the Shanghai Concert Hall, and the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London’s South Bank, to name a few.
The world-renowned guitar icon will share his story of mastering the classical guitar in a seminar titled ‘A discussion with Thibault Cauvin on his life and journey’ on 7 November 2019 at Auditorium Nouvelle Vague, Alliance Française de Dhaka.
