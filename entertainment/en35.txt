Priyanka Chopra Jonas is now a confident actress and producer who can play roles and take up responsibilities without feeling the pressure.
She says she stopped taking pressure when she reached the point where she could call the shots and make choices about the work that she wanted to do.
Was there any kind of pressure on her since she was playing dual roles?
That sort of shifted not too long ago, just four or five years ago maybe," Priyanka told IANS.
Now it doesn't," said Priyanka, also a known name in American showbiz, thanks to her show "Quantico".
