What does fiction mean?
This was a question posed by the anchor Sumana Roy at the session of Fiction: Resistance or Refuge at Dhaka Lit Fest 2019 on the premises of Bangla Academy in the capital on Thursday.
Both of them also found fiction offering both refuge and resistance.
She said, while writing one must choose resistance to be socially active.
