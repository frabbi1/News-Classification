At Amazon’s Machine learning, Automation, Robotics and Space (MARS) conference in Las Vegas, actor Robert Downey Jr took the stage to talk about his future goals to improve the environment.
Downey intends to launch a new foundation called The Footprint Coalition that would utilise robotics and nanotechnology to effectively clean the planet.
Operations are expected to begin in April 2020 with an aim to clean the world in the next decade.
Downey also explained the benefits of Artificial Intelligence (AI), a topic he is really interested in, much like his Iron Man character, Tony Stark.
In addition, he is producing a docu-series for YouTube with his wife, Susan Downey, about AI’s impact.
