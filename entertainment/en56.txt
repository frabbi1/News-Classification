Deepika, who is currently busy with the post-production work of her maiden project, 'Chhapaak', seems to be on a movie signing spree.
And now, a report in Pinkvilla states that Deepika will be saying yes to yet another project, which is the Hindi remake of Anushka Shetty starrer 'Arundhati'.
Sonu Sood played an antagonist in the original movie and the makers are on the lookout for signing male star opposite Deepika.
Interestingly, Deepika recently hinted at planning a dark romantic film, and in all probability, this could be it.
If Deepika comes on board for Hindi remake, there will be huge anticipation for the project.
