Colombian superstar Shakira says temporarily losing her voice two years ago was "the darkest moment" of her life, and which affected her "deeply".
- 'A miracle' -"When that doubt arose, when I did not know if I could sing again, it was the darkest moment of my life," she added.
In what she describes as "a miracle", Shakira recovered her voice naturally, without needing to undergo surgery as recommended by doctors and was finally able to carry out her tour in 2018.
"It is one of the most important tours of my life for what it means, for the different obstacles that I had to overcome," Shakira said.
But we will try to take advantage of it as much as possible, especially the opportunity to represent Latinos," Shakira said.
