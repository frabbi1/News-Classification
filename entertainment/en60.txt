Karina Kapoor and Aamir Khan are to rejoice in a new film named Lal Singh Chaddha where they will appear in a younger attire.
Some prosthetic makeup for her upcoming film Lal Singh Chaddha, which went on the floors recently, will be used.
While there will be VFX used to make Kareena look like a 20-year-old, the 39-year-old actress will also be using extensive makeup to look younger in some sequences in the film.
Aamir’s character Lal Singh Chaddha narrates the story of his life to a friend over the years, taking the film into multiple flashbacks in a non-linear narrative.
So both the central characters Kareena and Aamir will have portions with a younger look, which will require a certain kind of makeup to make the look as authentic as possible,” says a film industry source.
