Astute brushstrokes, applied with verve and panache, mingle together in a multitude of vibrant colours as an imposing dream-stricken visage stare from the canvas.
The surging passion of the execution of the painting Dream Face-2 reverberates in tincture and tone of the exhibits of Syed Iqbal’s 18th solo, My Broken Mind.
Iqbal has developed a forceful and dynamic style, that seeks to comprehend the meaning of life through fragmented, fractured, broken, elliptical images.
Vibrant colours in their dramatic intensity help channelise this energy in the Mindscape series.
This exhibition might as well be named Dear Life instead of My Broken Mind, because it is Syed Iqbal’s lust for life that still gets him going strong at mid-sixties.
