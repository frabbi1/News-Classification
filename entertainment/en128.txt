On November 7, 2019, Shayan Chowdhury Arnob took the stage at Jatra Biroti with his latest ensemble of Arnob and Friends.
Besides Arnob, the band consisted of Sunidhi Sikdar, Soumyadeep Sikdar Murshid on vocals and jazz musicians Imran Ahmed and Moihaimin Karim on guitar and bass respectively, among others.
Nearing the end of the serenading autumn night, Arnob performed Purono Shei Diner Kotha, and the entire room hummed together.
â€œIn our group, we classical musicians, Rabindra Sangeet singers, as well as a Sufi and Jazz ensemble.
The night ended with everyone taking home t-shirts designed by Arnob himself, as a reminder of how any rendezvous with him is memorable.
